 You can follow these steps to uninstall the driver.

 3\. Expand the category and find your printer from the list. Right-click on the printer device and click**Uninstall** .

  After uninstallting the driver, you can go to the manufacturer’s website to download the appropriate driver. Locate the driver depending on the specific system your computer is running.
