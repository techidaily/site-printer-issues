### Step 1 – Connect your Canon printer to the computer

 To set up a Canon printer, the first thing is connecting it to the computer. And there are three ways you can do that:

* [**USB connection**](#option1)
* **[Wi-Fi connection](#option2)**
* **[Wired network connection](#option3)**

#### Connect your printer via a USB cable

 If you want to connect the printer to your computer directly and print only from that device, you could choose the USB connection.

 Simply plug one end of the cable into the USB port on the Canon printer and the other into the USB port on your computer. Then, plug in the power cable and turn on the printer.

 After connecting the printer with your computer, you can follow**[Step 2](#step2)** to install the printer driver.

#### Connect your printer via Wi-Fi

 If your printer is wireless-capable, you can easily connect it via Wi-Fi. In this way, your printer will be able to print from any devices connected to the same wireless network, including computers, laptops, tablets or cell phones.

**1)** Plug in the power supply and turn on the printer.

**2)** On the printer’s control panel, use the arrow key to select**Menu** , and then select**Network Settings** .

 The steps to configure the printer’s networking settings may vary on different printer models. For more details, you can refer to the manual of your printer.

**4)** Select the**Wireless LAN settings** , and press**OK** . Then, select your network and enter the password.

 Make sure the printer is connected to the same wireless network with your computer.

 After the wireless connection is completed, you can proceed to**[Step 2](#step2)** .

#### Connect your printer via a wired network

 A wired connection allows multiple devices on a wired network to access the printer but requires the use of an Ethernet cable. You can connect your printer directly to the router as follow:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ethernet-cable-3.jpg)

**1)** Simply connect one end of the Ethernet cable into the printer and the other end of the cable into your router. Then, turn on the printer.

**2)** On the printer’s control panel, use the arrow key to select**Menu** , and then select**Network Settings** .

### Step 2 – Install the printer driver

 To let your Canon printer communicate properly with the computer, you’ll need to install the correct and up-to-date printer driver.

 If your computer automatically detects the printer, you could follow the on-screen instructions to install it. Otherwise, you’ll need to download and install the printer driver manually.

 You could directly insert the installation CD that comes with the Canon printer and launch the setup program. But if you don’t have the disc or if you lost it, here are 2 ways to get the printer drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#manually)**

**[Option2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#automatically)**

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Canon keeps updating the printer drivers. Follow the instruction below and you’ll learn how to get it from the official website.

**1)** Navigate to **[Canon’s support website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support)**  .

**2)** Enter your product model and select it from the search results.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-3-1.jpg)

**3)** Scroll down to the**Drivers & Downloads** section. Choose your**operating system** , and click**Select** next to the driver you’d like to download.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/55-1-1200x241.jpg)

**4)** Click**Download** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-0-1-1200x162.jpg)

**5)** Open the downloaded file, and click**Yes** when you’re prompted to continue.

 The setup wizard for different printer driver may be similar but not completely the same.

**6)** In the setup wizard, click**Next** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-6-4.jpg)

**7)** Click**Yes** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-7-1.jpg)

**8)** If you connect your printer via a USB cable, select the**USB connection** . If you use the Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection, select the**Network Connection** . Then, click**Next** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-9-3.jpg)

 Follow the wizard to complete the entire setup procedure, and you’ll be able to make your print with the newly-installed Canon printer!

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the printer driver

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your printer, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/de1.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged Canon printer driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version**).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)
