![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b0bce9823329.jpg)

 Debating whether or not to update your **HP Officejet 4630**  driver? Or you know itâ€™s time but still scouring for ways to get this done, neat and easy? Look no further, hereâ€™s just the guide for you! ðŸ˜‰

## When should I update my HP Officejet 4630  printer driver

 A printer driver is a tiny program that allows your printer to communicate with your computer.

Updating your printer driver can:

* help prevent crashes;
* improve both your computer and printer performance, etc.

 But if the driver for your printer is outdated/corrupt/wrong, it might cause further issues.

 If your**HP Officejet 4630** (aka.**HP Officejet 4630 e-All-in-One Printer series**) printer is acting a bit _off:_

* error notifications pop up randomly
* it wonâ€™t even print at all, etc.

then itâ€™s probably time to update the driver for it.

## Try these methods

 Both methods below work in Windows 10 and 7\. And as the method list suggests, you donâ€™t have to try both. Just decide if you want to do it manually or automatically and take your pick:

1. [Update my**HP Officejet 4630**  driver manually](#M1)
2. [Update my**HP Officejet 4630**  driver automatically(Recommended)](#M2)

### Method 1: update my**HP Officejet 4630**  driver manually

 By  updating our**HP Officejet 4630** driver _manually_ , I mean we go to the HPâ€™s official website, find out  the latest & correct version, download the file and install it all on our own. It needs time, patience, and certain levels of computer skills. If youâ€™re not comfortable playing  with device drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to [Method 2](#M2) .

 1) Go to [HP Customer Support](https://support.hp.com/ph-en/drivers) , click**Pinter** .

4) Double-click on the downloaded file to install your printer driver.

5) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect even if youâ€™re not asked to.

### Method 2: update my**HP Officejet 4630**  driver automatically(Recommended)

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
