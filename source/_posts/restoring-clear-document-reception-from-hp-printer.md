### Fix 2: Check your ink cartridges

 If your printer keeps printing blank pages, you should verify your cartridges are working properly. Here is what you should check:

 The following process may vary depending on different types of printers. If you don’t know how to do it, consult the printer manual for instructions.

#### Check whether your ink cartridges are clogged

 Your printer won’t function properly when the ink cartridges are blocked or clogged. If that’s the core issue, try cleaning your ink cartridges from the printer control panel or clean it manually.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/toner-581905_640.jpg)

#### Check the ink levels on your printer

 Low or empty cartridges can also cause the printer to print blank pages. So, check the ink/toner levels on your printer and replace cartridges if necessary.

#### **Reinstall your cartridges.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cartridges-828195_1280-900x1200.jpg)

 Printer issues might occur when your cartridges are defective or when the connection between cartridges and your printer is weak.

 Remove your cartridges to see if any cartridges are defective. If you find any damaged cartridges, replace it. If all your cartridges are in good condition, reinstall your cartridges.

 Make sure your cartridges are fine, then try printing a page. If your problem still exists, then go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 3: Update the printer driver

 Driver, or device driver, is a program that makes your computer and hardware attached work together. If the driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer, your printer won’t fully function, and issues like blank page printing are likely to occur.

 So updating the driver should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your HP printer. There are two ways you can get the right driver:

* **[Option 1 – Manually update your printer driver](#a1)**
* **[Option 2 – Automatically update the driver (Recommended)](#a2)**

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 HP keeps updating printer drivers. To get the latest driver for your printer, go to the [](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/printers) **[HP support website](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/printers)** [](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/printers) and find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically install the HP printer driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the printer driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-842.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](mailto:support@drivereasy.com) .**
