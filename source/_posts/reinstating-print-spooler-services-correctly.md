![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_59534ec3c4286.jpg)

 Many printer users have reported that their printer cannot print. This issue happens randomly. And it can be very frustrating especially when you try to print something urgently needed.

 But don’t worry. Here are some solutions you can try. You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

[**1) Basic troubleshooting**](#a)

[**2) Set your printer as default**](#b)

[**3) Cancel all print jobs**](#c)

[**4) Update printer driver**](#d)

[**5) Check hardware status**](#e)
  
## 1) Basic troubleshooting

 Once you find that your printer won’t print, you should check the status of the connection between your printer and computer. Make sure your printer is**properly connected** , and the**wireless network or cable** you use to connect your printer is**normal** .

 You can also**shut down** your computer and printer**completely** , wait for**a couple of minutes** , and then**power them on** again. After that you can try printing something and see if the problem resolves.  
  
## 2) Set your printer as default

 In normal cases, the computer will assign the printing tasks to**default printer** unless you specify another on purpose. Sometimes your default printer will be changed to another printer due to some reasons. In these cases, you should note that, in the program that you use to print, you have to **correctly select** your printer in order to print with the right one.

 If you want to set your printer back to default, please follow the steps below.

 **a)**  Press **Win + R**  keys. Type “_**control**_ ” and hit**Enter** .

**d)**  You printer is now set to default!  
  
## 3) Cancel all print jobs

 Another reason of printer not printing is that the print queue includes print jobs that has failed. Therefore the printer gets stuck. You need to clean all print jobs in order to get your printer back to normal.

**a)** Open **Devices and Printers**  settings (as**[the method above](#g)** shows).

**b)** Right click on your printer in**Printers** section and select**See what’s printing** .

**f)**  The print queue of your printer is clear. Now check and see if your printer can run normally.  
  
## 4) Update printer driver

 In many cases, printer won’t print issue comes from faulty drivers. You may need to update the driver or software to fix problems of this kind. In fact, updating drivers is usually an effective way to fix issues on your hardware, such as printer.

**a)**  You can go to the**official support website of your printing device** to find the latest driver and software. To do so, you need to search the website on Google, find the correct result and log in it, and then search the software you need inside the website and find the proper place to download it. After that you need to finish the installation process on your own.

**b)**  Another way to do this is to use**Device Manager** . To open Device Manager, press**Win + R** keys and then enter “_**devmgmt.msc**_ “. Then in Device Manager, you need to locate your printing devices (it can be under multiple categories), right click on it and select update its driver.

**c)**  If you want a**much** **simpler** way, you can use [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just hit the huge **Scan Now** button. It will quickly scan out the drivers you need.

 But if you want the program to**complete the whole update process** for you, you can upgrade it to [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## 5) Check hardware status

 If none of the methods above helps you, you may need to consider it as a hardware issue.

 You need to check if your printer runs out of**paper, ink or toner** , and check if your printer is stuck on**paper jam** . You may also need to check your**printer cartridge** or try replacing it with a new one. If the problem happens just after you replace a part of your printer, you can**install the original one back to your printer** and see if this fixes the problem.

 You can also contact your **device manufacturers** for further assistance if you find any hardware problem on your printer or your computer that you cannot handle.
