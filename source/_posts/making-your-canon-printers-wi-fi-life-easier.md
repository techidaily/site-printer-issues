 Trying to set up your Canon printer to your Wifi network? Or, you’ve already spent hours searching all over the Internet for a quick and easy setup? Look no further, this is just the guide for you, check it out! 😉

 Setting up your Canon printer to your Wifi network includes**Part 1** and**Part 2** . But if your Canon printer acts weird, you can check**Part 3** to address the problem.

1. [Connect my Canon printer to my Wifi](#P1)
2. [Add the wireless printer to computer](#P2)
3. [What to do if my Canon printer acts weird](#P3)

### Part 1: Connect my Canon printer to my Wifi

 Connecting your Canon printer to your Wifi should be as easy as pie once you follow these steps:

 1) Press**the power button** to turn on your printer.

 2) Press**the Settings button** . Then press**the arrrow button** and once you go to **Device settings** , press **OK** .

 3) Press**the arrrow button** until you see**LAN Settings** , press**OK** .

 4) Press **the arrrow button** until you go to**wireless LAN setup** , press**OK** .

 The printer will start searching for Wifi network, in the meanwhile, the light will be blinking.

 5) If the searching process takes too long, you can press**Stop** , and it’ll go to **wireless LAN setup, standard setup** . Press**OK** .

 6) Press**the arrrow button** until you find your Wifi network, and then press**OK** .

 7) Enter your**password** for the Wifi (**Enter passphrase**) and press**OK** .

**Enter passphrase :1** indicates our keyboard now is in a numeric state. Depending on our Wifi password, we might need to press**\*** to switch it to uppercase(**Enter passphrase :A**) and lowercase (**Enter passphrase :a**).

 8) Press**OK** again once the screen says**Connected** .

## **Part 2: Add your wireless Canon printer to computer**

 After connecting our Canon printer to Wifi, we might need to add it to our computer to get it to work. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R** at the same time. Then copy & paste **control /name Microsoft.DevicesAndPrinters**  into the box and click **OK** .

 Now you’ve completed the connecting your printer to your Wifi network. Try printing a test page and it should work. 😉

### Part 3: What to do if your printer is not working properly

 If your **Canon  printer**  acts a bit weird, say:

* error notifications pop up randomly
* it won’t even print at all, etc.

 chances are you have the outdated or corrupt printer driver. So you should update your printer driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_ALL_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
