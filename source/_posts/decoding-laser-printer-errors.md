 If you are a printer user, it is possible that you have encountered a**Printer in Error State** issue. If you come across one, an error message will pop up on your computer telling you your printer “**is in an error state** “. Your printer cannot get to work at this time.

 If you are trying to find some useful solutions to this problem. You can give the methods below a try. They can help you fix your printer in error state issue.

 **1)[Check the connection and restart your devices](#a)**

 **2)[Update or reinstall printer driver](#b)**

 **3) [Contact printer manufacturer](#c)**
  
## 1) Check the connection and restart your devices

 Once your printer is in an error state, you can perform some simple methods and see if they work.

 You can check whether the**connection between your printer and computer** functions normally. Make sure your devices**connect to each other** properly, and the**network** (either wireless or Bluetooth) or**cable** you use for the connection has no problem.

 Sometimes the problem can be fixed by**restarting** your devices. You can power off your computer and printer completely and leave them for a couple of minutes. After that turn them on and see if the error is gone.  
  
## 2) Update or reinstall printer driver

 Printer in error state can also result from faulty or incompatible printer driver. You will need to update or reinstall the driver to fix problems of this kind.

 One easy and credible way to deal with drivers is to use [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
