### Method 1: Check the connection of your Printer

 Once the error pops up on your Windows 10, and you cannot print the files with your printer, please check the connection between your printer and computer first.

 Case 1\. If your printer is connected via USB, please check if the USB cable is connected to your computer properly.

 Case 2\. If your printer is connected via wireless network, please check if the printer is connected to your own network.

 If after making sure your printer is connected properly, the error still persists, then go on to follow method 2 to reinstall your printer driver.
