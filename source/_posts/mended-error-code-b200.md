### Fix 1: Update your printer driver

 When something goes wrong with your Canon printer, updating its driver should always be your go-to option. Most printer issues, such as blank page printing, error code messages, and printer not responding, are often caused by a faulty printer driver.

There are two ways you can update your printer driver:

* **[Option 1 – Manually install the driver](#a1)** [](#a1)
* **[Option 2 – Automatically update your printer driver (Recommended)](#a2)**

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating printer drivers. Here’s how to get the latest correct one for your device:

**1)** Go to the **[Canon support website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support)**  , then click**SUPPORT > SOFTWARE & DRIVERS** .

**3)** Find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**4)** Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 The following process may vary depending on different types of printers. If you don’t know how to do it, consult your printer manual for instructions.

#### Check whether your ink cartridges are clogged
