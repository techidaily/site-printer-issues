### Fix 1: Update your printer driver

 When something goes wrong with your Canon printer, updating its driver should always be your go-to option. Most printer issues, such as blank page printing, error code messages, and printer not responding, are often caused by a faulty printer driver.

There are two ways you can update your printer driver:

* **[Option 1 – Manually install the driver](#a1)** [](#a1)
* **[Option 2 – Automatically update your printer driver (Recommended)](#a2)**

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating printer drivers. Here’s how to get the latest correct one for your device:

**1)** Go to the **[Canon support website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support)**  , then click**SUPPORT > SOFTWARE & DRIVERS** .
