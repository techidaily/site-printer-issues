## Disconnecting All Print Devices at Once on PC

You just purchased a new printer and would like to replace the old one at home. You think you have removed the printer and its driver, but when you reboot your computer, you can still see the printer’s icon, the only difference is that the icon all grayed out. In this case, it becomes impossible for you to uninstall or remove it again.
