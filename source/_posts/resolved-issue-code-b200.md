### Fix 1: Update your printer driver

 When something goes wrong with your Canon printer, updating its driver should always be your go-to option. Most printer issues, such as blank page printing, error code messages, and printer not responding, are often caused by a faulty printer driver.

There are two ways you can update your printer driver:

* **[Option 1 – Manually install the driver](#a1)** [](#a1)
* **[Option 2 – Automatically update your printer driver (Recommended)](#a2)**

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating printer drivers. Here’s how to get the latest correct one for your device:

**1)** Go to the **[Canon support website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support)**  , then click**SUPPORT > SOFTWARE & DRIVERS** .

**2)** Enter the name of the serial number of your Canon product and search for it.

**3)** Find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**4)** Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**1)** Uninstall the printhead.

**2)** Use pure alcohol or nonoily cleaning fluid to clean the gold contacts.

The printhead is very delicate. Please proceed with caution.

**3)** Flush the printhead under the hot water tap.

**4)** After the printhead is dried, reinstall it. Then, reopen your printer.

 Hopefully, your printer works properly now! If all fixes are tried without improvement, you’ll need to bring your printer to a repair store for some professional help.
