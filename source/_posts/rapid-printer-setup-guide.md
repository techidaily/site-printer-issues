## Rapid Printer Setup Guide

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/printer-1.jpg)

 If you’re plagued by slow printing, or your printer keeps you waiting forever for your prints, then you’ve come to the right place. In this post, we will tell you some solutions you can try to solve this problem.

## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Reset you printer](#Fix1)**
2. **[Check the printer preferences](#Fix2)**
3. **[Update your printer driver](#Fix3)**
4. **[Turn off Quiet Mode](#Fix4)**
5. **[Restart the print spooler service](#Fix5)**
6. **[Check the network connection](#Fix6)**
7. **[Update the printer firmware](#Fix7)**
8. **[Repair system files](#Fix8)**

### Fix 1: Reset your printer

 If your printer has been printing for a long time, the speed may begin to slow to protect the print mechanism from overheating or becoming damaged. To fix it, you’ll need to reset your printer. Here’s how:

1. With your printer turned on,**disconnect** the power cable from the printer.
2. **Unplug** the power cable from the wall outlet.
3. **Wait** for one minute.
4. **Reconnect** the power cable to your printer and the wall outlet.

 Try printing again. If the print speed is still so slow, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 2: Check the printer preferences

 The print speed can be affected by the print quality since different quality settings use different amounts of ink. Printing in “Best” quality can slow the print speed. So you can set the print quality to Normal or Draft to make your printer print faster. Here’s how:

#### in Windows 10

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**S** together, then type**printer** in the search bar, and click**Printers & scanners** to open it.

2. Click your Printer, then click**Manage** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/manage-printer.jpg)
3. Click**Printing preferences** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/printer-preferences.jpg)
4. In the pop-up window, navigate to the**Paper/Quality** tab. Select**Plain Paper** in the Media or Paper Type field. Under Quality Settings or Print Quality, select**Draft** ,**Normal** or**Standard** . Then click**OK** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/paper-quality.jpg)

#### in Windows 11

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Type**printer** , and click**Printers & scanners** from the list of results.

2. Click on your printer.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/win11-Default-printer.jpg)
3. Select**Printer preferences** .  

![Windows 11 - Check the printer preferences](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/win11-Printer-preferences.jpg)
4. Under the**Paper/Quality** tab, use the drop-down menu next to**Media** to select the appropriate paper type.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/win11-Select-the-appropriate-paper-type.jpg)

After applying the changes, test if the print speed goes back to normal.

If your printer still prints very slowly, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your printer driver

 The printer driver is a program that allows your computer to communicate with your printer. If you’re using a faulty or outdated printer driver, you may encounter a slow printing issue. To solve the potential problem and ensure your printer works properly, you need to make sure you’re using the latest printer driver.

 There are two ways to update your printer driver:**[manually](#manual)** or**[automatically](#automatic)** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your printer driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your printer, searching for the most recent correct driver, and then following the on-screen instructions to download and install it. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

Here we list the common printer manufacturers for you:

[**Canon**](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/drivers-downloads)

[**HP**](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/printers)

[**Brother**](https://www.brother.co.uk/support/drivers)

**[Epson](https://epson.com/Support/Printers/sh/s1)**

**[Lexmark](https://www.lexmark.com/en%5Fus/support/download-search.html)**

[**Xerox**](https://www.support.xerox.com/engb.html)

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your printer driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact printer, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/scannow.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged printer driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/update-all.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](mailto:support@drivereasy.com) .**

 After updating your printer driver, try to print. If the issue remains, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Turn off Quiet Mode

 The Quiet Mode setting can reduce printing noise but will slow the print speed. If that’s the case for you, you can fix the slow printing issue by turning off Quiet Mode. This will vary depending on the printer you’re using.

#### **For HP printer users:**

1. On your computer, open**HP Smart** .
2. Click your printer, then select**Advanced Settings** .

#### **For other printers users:**

 You can check your printer’s user manual or visit your printer manufacturer’s official website for help.

 After doing that, try your printer again. If this method doesn’t solve your problem, check out the next fix.

### Fix 5: Restart the print spooler service

**Print Spooler** is a Windows service that’s responsible for managing all print jobs getting sent to the computer printer or print server. A problem with the print spooler can affect printer driver performance and print queue responsiveness. If your printer suddenly prints so slowly, you can try restarting the print spooler service to see if it solves the problems. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box, then type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/services-msc.jpg)
2. In Services, find Print Spooler, right-click on it, and select**Stop** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/print-spooler-stop.jpg)  
**Note** : Do not close the Services window, simply minimize it as you’ll go back to it later.
3. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box, then type**spool** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spool.jpg)
4. Open the**PRINTERS** folder.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/printers-files.jpg)
5. Delete all files in this folder, then close it. This is to clear the print queues.
6. Go back to the Services window, right-click Print Spooler, and select**Start** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/print-spooler-start.jpg)

Now try your printer to see if the problem is resolved.

If your printer still prints at a slow speed, try the next fix below.

### Fix 6: Check the network connection

 If you’re using a network printer, you may encounter a slow printing issue due to a poor network connection. To fix it, you can try the following tips.

 If you’re using an Ethernet cable,**make sure that the cable is properly connected** .

 If you’re using a wireless printer,**try** **rebooting your router** . Simply unplug it from the power supply, wait for one minute, then plug it again.

**Close other programs that are not in use** , since some bandwidth-hogging applications can slow down your network speed and result in slow printing.

After checking your network connection, try to print again.

If your network is not the problem, continue to the next fix.
