## [Driver Search] Problem: Windows 10 Can't Find MP620 Printer Driver

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/canon-pixma-mo620.jpg)  If you want to update the printer driver for your Cannon MP620, but only find that Windows tells you “   **The best driver software for your device is already installed** .”, you’re not alone.

This notification basically means that Windows 10 fail to find your Canon MP620 driver from its database, so it is time you did it yourself: 1) Go to [**support website**](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support) of Canon. Enter the model name of your printer and then click **Go**.

 2) In the support website, drag down a little bit to 1) locate the**Driver & Downloads** button, 2) choose your operating system and 3) click the**Drivers** button.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pixma-mp620-driver-download-600x375.jpg) Canon has not yet released the printer driver for Windows 10 operating system, so we download the one for**Windows 8.1**instead. 3) Right-click the setup file and click **Properties**. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/properties-setup.jpg) 4) Go to**Compatibility**tab, then check the box for **Run this program in compatibility for:**and select **Windows 8**from the drop-down menu. Click**Apply**and**OK**to save.
