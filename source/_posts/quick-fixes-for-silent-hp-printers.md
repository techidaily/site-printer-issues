## Quick Fixes for Silent HP Printers

 What to do when your HP printer not responding? This usually caused by an incompatible driver. The printer driver is either outdated or corrupted, thus stopping you from printing normally.

 It can also be your Printer Spooler service, and you might need to restart the service for it to work again. In this post, we’ll walk you through the steps to fix the issue.

## Try these fixes

1. [**Restart the Print Spooler service**](#method-1)
2. [**Reinstall the printer driver**](#method-2)
3. [**Use the generic driver**](#method-2)
4. **[Use the Windows Troubleshooter](#method-4)**
