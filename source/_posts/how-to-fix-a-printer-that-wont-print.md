## 1) Basic troubleshooting

 Once you find that your printer won’t print, you should check the status of the connection between your printer and computer. Make sure your printer is**properly connected** , and the**wireless network or cable** you use to connect your printer is**normal** .

 You can also**shut down** your computer and printer**completely** , wait for**a couple of minutes** , and then**power them on** again. After that you can try printing something and see if the problem resolves.  
  
## 2) Set your printer as default

 In normal cases, the computer will assign the printing tasks to**default printer** unless you specify another on purpose. Sometimes your default printer will be changed to another printer due to some reasons.

 If you want to set your printer back to default, please follow the steps below.

 You can also contact your **device manufacturers** for further assistance if you find any hardware problem on your printer or your computer that you cannot handle.
