#### Run SFC scan

**System File Checker** (**SFC**) is a handy feature in Windows that helps scan your system files and repair missing or corrupted system files(including those related to **BSOD**). To **run the SFC scan** :

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and type cmd. Then right-click on **Command Prompt** and click **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28ad73ad4a9.png)

 2) Click**Yes** when prompted to confirm.

 3) In the command prompt window, type**sfc /scannow** and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28aee247664.jpg)

 It’ll take some time for the SFC to replace the corrupted system files with new ones if it detects any, so please be patient.

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Check your computer to see if the problem has been fixed. If yes, then congrats!
