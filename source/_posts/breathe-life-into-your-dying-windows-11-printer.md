 Outdated drivers usually cause all kinds of hardware issues. Therefore, updating related drivers is a way to fix printer issues on Windows 11\. Actually, the workaround provided by Microsoft suggests installing printer drivers with admin privileges, then the issue can be fixed.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
