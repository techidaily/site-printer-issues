You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

3. **[Update your printer driver](#s3)**
4. **[Set your printer as the default printer](#s4)**

**Note:** the screenshots below are taken from Windows 10, but the solutions apply to Windows 7/8 as well.

### Solution 2 – Do a full power cycle

Another solution that works for many users is **turning the computer, printer, and Wi-Fi completely off and then on again**. Doing so may help reinitialize the configurations and parameters sets of your printer or recover it from an unresponsive state. It’s also used to reset all the network configurations as they are all lost when you turn the device completely off. So, you might as well give it a go:

1. )**Turn off** your computer, printer and Wi-Fi.
2. **Unplug**  your computer and printer.
3. After a period of about**5 minutes** ,**plug in** both devices, turn them on and try connecting and printing something.

(see screenshot below)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8e23a869312.png) Then you can try **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

### Solution 4 – Set your printer as the default printer

If you’re using a Canon printer, setting your printer as the default printer in**Settings**may do the trick.

 Canon printers tend to have two printers listed in place of a single printer. One is a normal printer and the other has the same name but has a ‘WS’ at its end. If you are connected to the ‘WS’ printer, this may be causing the issue of “**Another computer is using the printer** “. Under such circumstances, all you need to do is simply**set the normal printer as the default printer** . Besides, you can remove the WS printer as it is not required.
