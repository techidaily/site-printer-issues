 It can also be your Printer Spooler service, and you might need to restart the service for it to work again. In this post, we’ll walk you through the steps to fix the issue.

## Try these fixes

1. [**Restart the Print Spooler service**](#method-1)
2. [**Reinstall the printer driver**](#method-2)
3. [**Use the generic driver**](#method-2)
4. **[Use the Windows Troubleshooter](#method-4)**

### Method 1\. Restart the Print Spooler service

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 6) Now the driver should be updated to the generic device now. You can check the status of the printer. If you’re still having the HP printer not responding problem, you can perform a Windows Update or try the Windows built-in troubleshooter, below.

### Method 4\. Use the Windows Troubleshooter

 If the methods above fail to solve your HP printer not responding issue, you can let Windows find the real problem for you. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Win + R** key, and enter**control** in the Run box.
