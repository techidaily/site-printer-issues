 Keep getting the error code B200? You’re not alone! Many Canon users are reporting it. But don’t worry. You can fix it Here are 3 solutions to try.

## 3 simple fixes to try

 In most cases, getting the error B200 indicates that the printhead of your Canon printer is dead. Apart from that, defective ink cartridges and a corrupt printer driver can also trigger this problem. But before you rush out to buy a new printhead, check the fixes below.

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Update your printer driver](#a)**
2. **[Check your ink cartridges](#b)**
3. **[Clean the printhead](#c)**

### Fix 1: Update your printer driver

 When something goes wrong with your Canon printer, updating its driver should always be your go-to option. Most printer issues, such as blank page printing, error code messages, and printer not responding, are often caused by a faulty printer driver.

There are two ways you can update your printer driver:

* **[Option 1 – Manually install the driver](#a1)** [](#a1)
* **[Option 2 – Automatically update your printer driver (Recommended)](#a2)**

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating printer drivers. Here’s how to get the latest correct one for your device:

**1)** Go to the **[Canon support website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support)**  , then click**SUPPORT > SOFTWARE & DRIVERS** .

**2)** Enter the name of the serial number of your Canon product and search for it.

**3)** Find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**4)** Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Fix 2: Check your ink cartridges

 Printer errors sometimes appear because the ink cartridge is not properly installed or it’s damaged. So, you should check if your cartridges are working fine. Here is what you should check:

 The following process may vary depending on different types of printers. If you don’t know how to do it, consult your printer manual for instructions.

#### Check whether your ink cartridges are clogged

 Blocked or clogged ink cartridges can cause the printer error B200\. To see if that’s the problem for you, you can clean your ink cartridges from the printer control panel or clean them manually.

#### Check the ink levels on your printer

#### **Remove and reinstall your cartridges.**

 The Error B200 is most likely to occur when the printhead is clogged. Follow the instructions below to clean the printhead:

**1)** Uninstall the printhead.

**2)** Use pure alcohol or nonoily cleaning fluid to clean the gold contacts.

The printhead is very delicate. Please proceed with caution.

**3)** Flush the printhead under the hot water tap.

**4)** After the printhead is dried, reinstall it. Then, reopen your printer.
