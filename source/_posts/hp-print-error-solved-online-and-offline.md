## HP Print Error: Solved - Online & Offline

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_59113ae0e52f4.png)

This post helps you with your HP Printer showing Offline status on Windows 10 and Windows 7\. If you see Printer Status Offline, then your printer does not print, since Offline indicates that your PC is not able to communicate with the printer. In some cases, it is unexpected. To get your printer working normally again, please follow the instructions here. You can totally do this by yourself. **[Step 1: Check Connection Problems](#a)** [**Step 2: Set Default Printer**](#b) [**Step 3: Reset Printer**](#c) [**Step 4: Update Printer Firmware**](#d) [**Step 5: Update Printer Driver**](#e)   **Step 1: Check Connection Problems** 1)**DO NOT connect to a guest or host network**. Please make sure that your printer is **NOT**connected to a guest or host network as they might have additional security features, such as preventing printers from connecting and thus printing. 2)**Switch from wireless to a USB or Ethernet connection**. In some case, the culprit is the wireless connection. To make sure that the problem is not caused by your printer, check your printer manual to see how to switch the printer to a USB or Ethernet connection. 3)**Try your printer on another computer**. If you have a second PC, try installing the printer driver and then try connecting the printer using the same type of connection. If the Offline status remains, then it is the printer that is the culprit. You may need to call HP support for more assistance. If the Offline status is gone, then the issue is with your first PC. **Step 2: Set Default Printer**1) Restart your HP printer. 2) On your keyboard, click**Windows** key, then choose**Control Panel**. In Control Panel window, choose to View by**Large icons**and then choose**Devices and Printer**.

6) See if your printer goes offline again.   **Step 3: Reset Printer**1) Turn on your printer first if it is off. 2) With your printer on, disconnect the power cord from the printer. 3) Unplug the power cord from the wall outlet. 4) Wait for at least 1 minute. Restart your PC. 5) Plug the power cord back onto the wall. 6) Then reconnect the power cord to your printer. 7) Press the power button to turn on your printer if it is not on. 8) Make sure that the printer is connected to the computer or the network. 9) See if you can print now. If the Offline status remains, you need to follow the steps below.   **Step 4: Update Printer Firmware**HP regularly releases new printer firmware versions for its inkjet and LaserJet series. The newer version of firmware allows your printer to work more smoothly and fix minor issues. To update the firmware for your printer: 1) You can update directly from the printer. To do so, you need to check your printer manual for more detailed information since the workarounds differ on different printers. 2) If updating via the printer is not working for you, there is always an alternative. You can update your printer firmware from the HP website. 2.1) Make sure that your printer is connected to your PC. 2.2) Go to HP support, then navigate to**Software and Drivers**tab. Type in the model of your printer and hit**Enter**.
