## 1) Basic troubleshooting

 Once you find that your printer won’t print, you should check the status of the connection between your printer and computer. Make sure your printer is**properly connected** , and the**wireless network or cable** you use to connect your printer is**normal** .

 You can also**shut down** your computer and printer**completely** , wait for**a couple of minutes** , and then**power them on** again. After that you can try printing something and see if the problem resolves.  
  
## 2) Set your printer as default

 In normal cases, the computer will assign the printing tasks to**default printer** unless you specify another on purpose. Sometimes your default printer will be changed to another printer due to some reasons. In these cases, you should note that, in the program that you use to print, you have to **correctly select** your printer in order to print with the right one.

 If you want to set your printer back to default, please follow the steps below.

 **a)**  Press **Win + R**  keys. Type “_**control**_ ” and hit**Enter** .

## 5) Check hardware status

 If none of the methods above helps you, you may need to consider it as a hardware issue.

 You need to check if your printer runs out of**paper, ink or toner** , and check if your printer is stuck on**paper jam** . You may also need to check your**printer cartridge** or try replacing it with a new one. If the problem happens just after you replace a part of your printer, you can**install the original one back to your printer** and see if this fixes the problem.

 You can also contact your **device manufacturers** for further assistance if you find any hardware problem on your printer or your computer that you cannot handle.
