### Step 2: Install the printer driver for your printer

 Insert your printer driver CD that came with the your printer and run the printer setup application (usually “setup.exe”) to install the driver for your printer.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
