## 5) Check printer driver

 Sometimes Printer not responding error can be caused by driver issues. To fix the problem, you need to update your driver if it is outdated, or reinstall the driver if it is problematic.

Or you can go to Device Manager of the system and update or reinstall the driver (after you find your printer from a long list of device). Either way is a good way, yet a bit tricky, and sometimes time- and energy-consuming.
