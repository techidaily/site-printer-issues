 If you are a printer user, it is possible that you have encountered a**Printer in Error State** issue. If you come across one, an error message will pop up on your computer telling you your printer “**is in an error state** “. Your printer cannot get to work at this time.

 If you are trying to find some useful solutions to this problem. You can give the methods below a try. They can help you fix your printer in error state issue.

 **2)[Update or reinstall printer driver](#b)**

 **3) [Contact printer manufacturer](#c)**
  
## 1) Check the connection and restart your devices
