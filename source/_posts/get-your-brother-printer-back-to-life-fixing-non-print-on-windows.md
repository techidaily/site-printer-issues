## Why is my Brother printer not printing?

 There are several reasons that your Brother printer fails to work properly, including**incorrect connectivity** ,**outdated printer driver** and**faulty configurations** . Whatever the cause is, you can fix it in a few steps.

## Here’re the fixes

 You don’t need to try them all. Simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

2. **[Set your Brother printer as the default device](#fix2)**
3. **[Restart the Print Spooler service](#fix3)**

8. **[Factory reset your Brother printer](#fix8)**

 The screenshots below are from Windows 10, but the fixes also apply to Windows 11, Windows 7 and Windows 8.

## Fix 1 – Check the connection

 It’s necessary for you to do some basic checks before heading into the more complicated fixes. First off, make sure the connection status between the printer and computer is in the normal state.

### If you’re using a USB printer

 If you connect the printer to your computer via a USB cable, simply re-plug it and also try another USB port on your computer in case the one you previously used is broken.

### If you’re using a wireless printer

 For users with a wireless Brother printer, it’s essential to confirm the printer and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.

 If the Brother printer still doesn’t work, try the next method below.

## Fix 2 – Set your Brother printer as the default device

 Your computer tends to use the default printer every time you print. Therefore, you should set your Brother printer as the default device to undertake all the print jobs. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Type**control** in the field and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-1-2.jpg)
2. Select**Small icons** from the drop-down menu next to**View by** . Then, click**Devices and Printers** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-2-2.jpg)
3. Right-click your**Brother printer** and click**Set as default printer** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-4.jpg)

 Now do some prints to test if this method helps. If yes, then congrats! If not, there’re more fixes to try.

---

## Fix 3 – Restart the Print Spooler service

 Your computer won’t send the print jobs to your Brother printer if the Print Spooler service is not working properly. To get your printer back to running, you can simply restart this service.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to open the Run box. Type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-1.jpg)
2. Right-click**Print Spooler** . If it isn’t running,**Start** this service; if it’s already started, click**Restart** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-2.jpg)
3. After the Print Spooler service is restarted, right-click**Print Spooler** again and click**Properties** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-3-2.jpg)
4. Set the**Startup type** to**Automatic** . Then, click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-4.jpg)

 Now see if your Brother printer returns to normal and acts the way it should. If the same problem occurs, the culprit may be your printer driver, and please check out Fix 4.

## Fix 4 – Update your printer driver

 A range of printer-related problems is caused by a wrong or out-of-date printer driver. So if you’re troubled by the non-working Brother printer, be sure to update its driver and see if the problem gets resolved. There’re two options for you:**[manually](#option1)** or**[automatically](#option2)** .

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Brother keeps updating drivers for its printers. You can search for the latest driver on **[Brother’s support website](https://support.brother.com/g/b/productsearch.aspx?c=us%5Fot&lang=en&content=dl)**  , find the one corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download it.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update the printer driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

3. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to open the File Explorer.
4. Copy the address_**%windir%\\System32\\spool\\PRINTERS**_ and paste it to the address bar. Then, press**Enter** on your keyboard.
