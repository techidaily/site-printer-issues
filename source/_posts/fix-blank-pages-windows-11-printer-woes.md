3. If there is an available update, windows will download and install it automatically.
4. Then reboot your PC to check the printer issue is fixed or not.

## Fix 2: Update printer driver

 Outdated drivers usually cause all kinds of hardware issues. Therefore, updating related drivers is a way to fix printer issues on Windows 11\. Actually, the workaround provided by Microsoft suggests installing printer drivers with admin privileges, then the issue can be fixed.

## Fix 4: Repair system file

 Missing, corrupt or damaged system files may cause all kinds of issues including printer issues. To eliminate this issue as a possible cause, you can try the 2 ways below to repair possible system file issues.

1. [**Repair & replace corrupt system files with Fortect**](#REIMAGE)
2. [**Run SFC scan**](#SFC)

#### Repair & replace corrupt system files with Fortect

 The driver crashing issue could be caused by corrupt system files. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a tool that specializes in Windows repairing and fixing corrupt files automatically.

 Fortect will first scan your computer’s operating system for viruses, malware, and missing or damaged files, then it removes all problematic files found and replaces them with new files. It’s like a clean reinstall of your operating system, except that you won’t lose any user data, and all programs, settings are exactly as they are before the repair.

Here’s how to use Fortect to repair system files on your PC:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.

3. Fortect will scan your computer thoroughly. This may take a few minutes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)
4. Once done, you’ll see a detailed report of all the issues on your PC. To fix them automatically, click**START REPAIR** . This requires you to purchase the full version. But don’t worry. If Fortect doesn’t solve the issue, you can request a refund within 60 days.

5. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
6. Check your computer to see if the driver crash issue is fixed.

 The Pro version of Fortect comes with 24/7 technical support. If you need any assistance, please contact Fortect support:  
 Email: **<support@fortect.com>**

#### Run SFC scan

**System File Checker** (**SFC**) is a handy feature in Windows that helps scan your system files and repair missing or corrupted system files(including those related to **BSOD**). To **run the SFC scan** :

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and type cmd. Then right-click on **Command Prompt** and click **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28ad73ad4a9.png)

 2) Click**Yes** when prompted to confirm.

 3) In the command prompt window, type**sfc /scannow** and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28aee247664.jpg)

 It’ll take some time for the SFC to replace the corrupted system files with new ones if it detects any, so please be patient.

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Check your computer to see if the problem has been fixed. If yes, then congrats!
