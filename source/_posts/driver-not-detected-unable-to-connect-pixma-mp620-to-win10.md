## [Driver Not Detected] Unable to Connect Pixma MP620 to WIN10

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/canon-pixma-mo620.jpg)  If you want to update the printer driver for your Cannon MP620, but only find that Windows tells you “   **The best driver software for your device is already installed** .”, you’re not alone.

This notification basically means that Windows 10 fail to find your Canon MP620 driver from its database, so it is time you did it yourself: 1) Go to [**support website**](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support) of Canon. Enter the model name of your printer and then click **Go**.

 2) In the support website, drag down a little bit to 1) locate the**Driver & Downloads** button, 2) choose your operating system and 3) click the**Drivers** button.

Click**Apply**and**OK**to save.

5) Now install the setup as you install other setup files. After the installation, restart your computer and your printer for the changes to take effect.
