## Optimize WIN10 Printer Performance and Speed

 After you upgrade the system to Windows 10 from Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, if your printer doesn’t work at all or doesn’t print properly, the printer driver is most probably damaged or incompatible with Windows 10\. You can fix the issue by reinstalling and updating the printer driver.

 Microsoft indicates that Windows 10 will remove some apps and software which are incompatible with the new operating system. This could happen to some printer drivers. Some printer manufacturers such as Canon, Brother, Dell, Epson have updated the Windows 10 drivers for their vast majority of printers. Some manufacturers such as Panasonic haven’t updated the drivers in timely fashion, reporting that Windows 10 drivers for their printers will be available in the near future.

 Following are three ways you can use to update the printer drivers in Windows 10.

**[Way 1: Update your printer driver manually](#way1)**

**[Way 2: Use Windows Update for new drivers](#way2)**

**[Way 3: Update your printer driver automatically](#way3)**

## **Way 1: Update your printer driver manually**

 You can go to your printer manufacturer’s website to check if your printer model supports Windows 10\. If yes, you can download and install the Windows 10 driver for your printer  . If not, you can download the latest version that the manufacturer has released like Windows 8 version or Windows 7 version  . They may be compatible with Windows 10\.  The driver download can be normally found in Support section. After you download the driver, you can always double-click on the installer file to install the driver.

For some printers, you need to update the drivers manually step by step.

 1) Open [**Control Panel**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 2) View by Small icons. Click **Device Manager** .
