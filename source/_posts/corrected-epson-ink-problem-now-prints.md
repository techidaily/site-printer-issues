 If it does, great! But if not, there are three more fixes for you to try…

## Method 5: Clear all print jobs

 You can’t use your Epson printer if the print queue of your printer gets stuck. In this case, you need to clear your print queue so you can use your printer.

 **What are print jobs?**
 When you try to print a file, your computer will place this task as a print job in the print queue (a queue of print jobs that is going to be printed) of your printer on your computer. Sometimes a print job in the queue gets stuck and stops the other print jobs in the queue from being printed.

To clear your print jobs:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type “_**services.msc**_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Services window.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f1bc9808a1b.png)
2. Double click**Print Spooler** .

3. Click**Stop** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a1317d8a2.png)
4. Minimize the Services window. Then open**File Explorer** (on your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E**  at the same time).  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a36c12e67.jpg)
5. Copy and paste the address**`%windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS`** to the address bar and press**Enter** on your keyboard to go to where the print jobs are stored.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a48b237b4.jpg)
6. Delete all the files in this folder.

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f29629de1e9.jpg)
8. Click the**Start** button. After the service is started, click**OK** to save the change and close this dialog.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a9e345daa.png)
9. Close all the opened windows and turn off your computer.
10. Turn off your printer and unplug the power cable from it.
11. Leave your printer for at least one minute.
12. Plug the power cable to your printer and turn it on.

## Method 6: Use another program to print your document

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Method 7: Check the status of your printer

 If you have tried all the methods above and your printer still can’t print, you should check the hardware status of your printer.

1. Check to see if you’re running out of **ink** or**toner** . You should replace the ink or toner cartridge when necessary.
2. If the issue occurs when you’ve**replaced a** **part** in your printer, install the original part and see if this fixes your issue.
3. You should also check if there is any**error displayed on your printer screen** . If it does, consult the user guide or the the customer support of Epson for instructions to fix the error.
4. If you are experiencing any issue you can’t resolve yourself, contact the customer support of Epson or bring it to an authorized service provider to**have it serviced** .
