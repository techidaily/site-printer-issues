## Quick Fix: Laser Print Nozzle Blockage

 Argh! Your**Epson printer** throws up a**0xf1 error code** and now it refuses to print! Actually, there are a few known reasons. And a few fixes that work for most users…

## How to fix Epson Error Code 0xf1

 Here are four fixes that have helped other users resolve the**0xf1 error code** **on Epson Pinter** issue. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Update your printer driver](#F1)**
2. **[Reinstall your Epson printer](#F2)**
3. **[Run Windows Troubleshooter](#F3)**
4. **[Check your printer for hardware issues](#F4)**

### Fix 1: Update your printer driver

 One of the most common causes for the 0xf1 error is incompatible or outdated printer drivers. So you should update your printer driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

### Fix 2: Reinstall your Epson printer

 This error may throw up if your printer is not properly installed. So it’s recommended that you reinstall your printer to see if the issue gets fixed.

Here is how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type**control /name Microsoft.DevicesAndPrinters** and press**Enter** . This is to fire up the**Device and Printers** window.

3) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

4) Open the**Device and Printers** window again. Then right-click on the blank area and select**Add device and printers** .

 6) Check to see if the 0xf1 error code still occurs. If it doesn’t show up, then great – you have solved the issue! If it still occurs and interrupts the printing process, don’t worry – here are two more fixes for you to try.

### Fix 3: Run Windows Troubleshooter

 Windows comes with a number of ‘troubleshooters’ that are designed to detect the hardware components on your computer and solve the issues for you. So you can run the printer troubleshooter to see if it can detect the problem and hopefully sort it out.

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and type **troubleshoot** , then click on **Troubleshoot settings**  once it pops up as a search result.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-41.png)

 2) In the **Troubleshoot**  window, scroll down to the **Get up and running**  section, click on **Printer** \> **Run the troubleshooter** .

### Fix 4: Check your printer for hardware issues

 Apart from the troubleshooting above, you should also keep an eye out for potential hardware issues.

 Here are a few steps you might want to refer to if you want to do further troubleshooting.

1) Turn off your printer.

2) Check the paper tray or feed roller inside your printer to see if there is any dust or paper that might be jammed inside. If yes, then open the paper output cover carefully, then gently remove the dust or paper and close the cover.

3) Check to see if the printheads are faulty. If yes, then carefully take out the printhead and clean it with a piece of clean dry cloth.

4) Turn on your printer.

5) Try printing again to see if the error still pops up.
