**If you are using a network printer:**

* Check your network connection as well as your network devices like your router and modem.
* View the network connection status of your printer and see if your printer is properly connected to the network.
* Reconnect or replace your network cable when necessary if your printer is using wired connection.
* For wireless printer, try reconnecting your printer to your home or work network.

 You may need to consult your printer manual for instructions when reconnecting your network printer.

**If you connect your printer via Bluetooth:**

* Make sure your printer is close enough to your computer.
* Try re-pairing your printer with your computer and see if this solves your problem.

 Check your printer manual for information about how to re-pair your printer and your computer.

## Method 2: Set your printer as the default printer

 If it does, great! But if not, there are three more fixes for you to try…

## Method 5: Clear all print jobs

 You can’t use your Epson printer if the print queue of your printer gets stuck. In this case, you need to clear your print queue so you can use your printer.

 **What are print jobs?**
 When you try to print a file, your computer will place this task as a print job in the print queue (a queue of print jobs that is going to be printed) of your printer on your computer. Sometimes a print job in the queue gets stuck and stops the other print jobs in the queue from being printed.

To clear your print jobs:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type “_**services.msc**_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Services window.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f1bc9808a1b.png)
2. Double click**Print Spooler** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f29629de1e9.jpg)
3. Click**Stop** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a1317d8a2.png)
4. Minimize the Services window. Then open**File Explorer** (on your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E**  at the same time).  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a36c12e67.jpg)
5. Copy and paste the address**`%windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS`** to the address bar and press**Enter** on your keyboard to go to where the print jobs are stored.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a48b237b4.jpg)
6. Delete all the files in this folder.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2ab14ccc48.jpg)
7. Restore the Services window. Then double click the**Print Spooler** service.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f29629de1e9.jpg)
8. Click the**Start** button. After the service is started, click**OK** to save the change and close this dialog.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a9e345daa.png)
9. Close all the opened windows and turn off your computer.
10. Turn off your printer and unplug the power cable from it.
11. Leave your printer for at least one minute.
12. Plug the power cable to your printer and turn it on.
13. Turn on your computer. Then check to see if your Epson printer is able to print.

## Method 6: Use another program to print your document

 You may have a not printing issue with your printer if the program you are using to print is not working properly. Test your printer with another program. If the problem comes from your program, contact its developer or vendor for advice or install an alternative solution.

## Method 7: Check the status of your printer

 If you have tried all the methods above and your printer still can’t print, you should check the hardware status of your printer.

1. Check to see if you’re running out of **ink** or**toner** . You should replace the ink or toner cartridge when necessary.
2. If the issue occurs when you’ve**replaced a** **part** in your printer, install the original part and see if this fixes your issue.
3. You should also check if there is any**error displayed on your printer screen** . If it does, consult the user guide or the the customer support of Epson for instructions to fix the error.
4. If you are experiencing any issue you can’t resolve yourself, contact the customer support of Epson or bring it to an authorized service provider to**have it serviced** .
