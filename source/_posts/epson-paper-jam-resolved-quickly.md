## Method 1: Check your printer connection

 Your Epson printer may not be connected to your computer properly. So it’s worth checking the connection between your printer and your computer.

**If you are using a USB cable to connect your printer:**

* Check if the cable is properly connected. If it isn’t, reconnect the cable and make sure they are properly seated into the ports on both your printer and your computer.
* Connect your printer directly to your computer without using a hub.
* Try connecting the cable to another USB port on your computer and see if this works for you.
* You may also need to experiment with another cable and see if there is any problem with the cable you’re using.

**If you are using a network printer:**

* Check your network connection as well as your network devices like your router and modem.
* View the network connection status of your printer and see if your printer is properly connected to the network.
* Reconnect or replace your network cable when necessary if your printer is using wired connection.
* For wireless printer, try reconnecting your printer to your home or work network.

 You may need to consult your printer manual for instructions when reconnecting your network printer.

**If you connect your printer via Bluetooth:**

* Make sure your printer is close enough to your computer.
* Try re-pairing your printer with your computer and see if this solves your problem.

 Check your printer manual for information about how to re-pair your printer and your computer.

6. Check to see if your Epson printer is able to print now.

 If it does, great! But if not, there are three more fixes for you to try…

## Method 5: Clear all print jobs

 You can’t use your Epson printer if the print queue of your printer gets stuck. In this case, you need to clear your print queue so you can use your printer.

 **What are print jobs?**
 When you try to print a file, your computer will place this task as a print job in the print queue (a queue of print jobs that is going to be printed) of your printer on your computer. Sometimes a print job in the queue gets stuck and stops the other print jobs in the queue from being printed.

To clear your print jobs:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type “_**services.msc**_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Services window.

## Method 6: Use another program to print your document

 You may have a not printing issue with your printer if the program you are using to print is not working properly. Test your printer with another program. If the problem comes from your program, contact its developer or vendor for advice or install an alternative solution.

## Method 7: Check the status of your printer

 If you have tried all the methods above and your printer still can’t print, you should check the hardware status of your printer.

1. Check to see if you’re running out of **ink** or**toner** . You should replace the ink or toner cartridge when necessary.
2. If the issue occurs when you’ve**replaced a** **part** in your printer, install the original part and see if this fixes your issue.
3. You should also check if there is any**error displayed on your printer screen** . If it does, consult the user guide or the the customer support of Epson for instructions to fix the error.
4. If you are experiencing any issue you can’t resolve yourself, contact the customer support of Epson or bring it to an authorized service provider to**have it serviced** .
