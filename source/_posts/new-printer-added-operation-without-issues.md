 “**Unable to install Printer.Operation could not be completed** ” could occur during installing printer or using the printer, especially after a Windows upgrade or reinstall. The problem can be caused by several issues. If you run into this problem, just try the **three**  solutions below and the problem should resolve.

## Solution**1: Start the Print Spooler service**

 The problem can occur if the print spooler service is stopped. So make sure the service is started. If it’s stopped, start it. To check and start the service, follow these steps:

1) Press **Win+R**  (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the Run box.

2) Type **services.msc** in the run box and click **OK** .

## **Solution 2: Update the printer driver**

 A faulty, corrupt or missing printer driver can caused “Unable to install Printer.Operation could not be completed” error. To resolve the issue, you can update the printer driver.

 If you don’t have time, patience and computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. **But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee)** :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

## **Solution 3: Delete the printer keys**

 The problem can be caused by driver conflicting. To resolve the problem, you can delete the certain registry entries.

**IMPORTANT** : Modifying registry incorrectly can cause serious system issues. Before following the below procedures, it’s recommended that you back up the registry first, then you could restore them if necessary. See [How to Back Up and Restore Registry](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

To delete the printer keys, here’s what you need to do:

**Firstly, Stop the “Print Spooler” service first** (Refer to**Solution 1** to stop the Print Spooler service). Then follow steps below:

1) Delete all contents from following folders:
