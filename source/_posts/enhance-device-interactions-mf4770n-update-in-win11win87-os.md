### **Option 2: Update your Canon MF4770n driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Canonâ€™s official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PCâ€™s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.
