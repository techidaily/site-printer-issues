### Solution 4 – Set your printer as the default printer

If you’re using a Canon printer, setting your printer as the default printer in**Settings**may do the trick.

 Canon printers tend to have two printers listed in place of a single printer. One is a normal printer and the other has the same name but has a ‘WS’ at its end. If you are connected to the ‘WS’ printer, this may be causing the issue of “**Another computer is using the printer** “. Under such circumstances, all you need to do is simply**set the normal printer as the default printer** . Besides, you can remove the WS printer as it is not required.
