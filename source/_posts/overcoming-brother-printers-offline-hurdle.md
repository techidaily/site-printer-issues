**e)** Open the file you have downloaded and follow the instruction to install the latest driver and software for your printer.

**\*** In fact, having your drivers updated is one of the most**useful** ways to tackle computer issues. But as you can see updating drivers manually is a little bit**tricky** . If you want a**far less troublesome** method to update drivers, we recommend you to use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It can**quickly** scan out the problematic drivers and download the**latest** and**credible** version of drivers for you.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5940b663b0cc3.png)

 And its **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a much more powerful driver management tool. You can update all of your drivers**quickly** and**automatically** with just a few clicks. Plus, you can use this tool to**easily** finish**advanced driver manipulations** such as**driver backup and restore** or**reinstallation** . This is the tool that can**greatly improve your computer performance** and**considerably save your time and energy** .

## 6) Check your printer

 You also need to ensure your printer is**powered on** or**waken from sleep mode** when you see it is offline. In the meantime, check the**LCD screen** of your printer and see if it displays any**error message** that you can troubleshoot.

 You can try**restarting** the printer and see if this fixes the problem. Or you can follow the instruction of the printer to**reset it to factory settings** .

 If you encounter any problem that you cannot handle on your own, you may need to contact Brother support crew for further assistance.
