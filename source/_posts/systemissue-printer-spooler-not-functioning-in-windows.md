 If the troubleshooter can’t help you fix the issue, take a look at the next method.

### Fix 3:**Reinstall your printer driver**

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the**Run box** .

4. Click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/device-manager-reinstall-printer-03.jpg)

Be sure to download the latest correct driver installer that’s compatible with your system. If you’re not familiar with computer drivers, you can use [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to**repair and update drivers automatically** .
