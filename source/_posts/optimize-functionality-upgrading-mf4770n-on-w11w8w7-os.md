Itâ€™s essential to **update your the**   **driver for your Canon MF4770n printer** so as to keep it in tip top condition and nip all problems such as system crashes, printer not printing issues in the bud. In this post, weâ€™re going to show you 2 safe and easy ways to get the latest driver for your Canon MF4770n printer.

### **Option 2: Update your Canon MF4770n driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Canonâ€™s official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PCâ€™s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

1. Go to **[Canonâ€™s official website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home)**  , type **Canon MF4770n** in the box, and press**Enter** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b03f1a0cf44c.png)

3. Scroll down the new page to the bottom and a list of printer drivers compatible with your operating system will be listed (**Windows 10** ,**x64** in my case). Click**the first result** to make sure you download the latest driver release. Then click**DOWNLOAD** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b03db3044199.jpg)
4. Double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the installation.
5. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect even if youâ€™re not asked to.
6. Skip this step if you can scan over a network/with a USB connection in your Windows system. But if you fail to do in either of them, you might need to go back to the download page to download & install a patch for it. Follow the prompts to so that the patch can solve the issue for you.
