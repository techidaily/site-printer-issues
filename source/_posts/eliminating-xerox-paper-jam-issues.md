### Fix 1: Update your printer driver

 One of the most common causes for the 0xf1 error is incompatible or outdated printer drivers. So you should update your printer driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

### Fix 3: Run Windows Troubleshooter

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and type **troubleshoot** , then click on **Troubleshoot settings**  once it pops up as a search result.

 2) In the **Troubleshoot**  window, scroll down to the **Get up and running**  section, click on **Printer** \> **Run the troubleshooter** .

### Fix 4: Check your printer for hardware issues

 Apart from the troubleshooting above, you should also keep an eye out for potential hardware issues.

 Here are a few steps you might want to refer to if you want to do further troubleshooting.

1) Turn off your printer.

2) Check the paper tray or feed roller inside your printer to see if there is any dust or paper that might be jammed inside. If yes, then open the paper output cover carefully, then gently remove the dust or paper and close the cover.

3) Check to see if the printheads are faulty. If yes, then carefully take out the printhead and clean it with a piece of clean dry cloth.

4) Turn on your printer.

5) Try printing again to see if the error still pops up.
