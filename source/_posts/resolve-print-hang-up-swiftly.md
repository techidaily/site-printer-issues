 There are three options for you to clear the print queue. You don’t have to try them all; just take your pick.

#### Option 1: Restart the Print Spooler Service

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** +**R** at the same time to open the**Run** box.
2. In the Run window, type**services.msc** and hit**Enter** .

3. Scroll down to**Print Spooler** .
4. Right-click**Print Spooler** and select**Stop** .

7. Go back to the**Print Job** queue. All print jobs should have been removed now and you can start printing again normally.

**Have trouble deleting the files?**
  
 Before deleting the files in the PRINTERS folder, you need to stop the Printer Spooler first. Otherwise, you’ll get an error message that says something like**The action cannot be completed because the file is open** .  
  
 After deleting the files, don’t forget to restart the service again.

#### Option 2: Use Command Prompt to Clear Stuck Files

 The fastest way to clear the print queue is through the command prompt. It just takes a few commands:

1. Type**cmd** in the search box and Run it as administrator.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/command-prompt-admin.jpg)
2. In the Command Prompt window, enter the following commands separately:

net stop spooler

del %systemroot%\System32\spool\printers\* /Q **/F /S**

net start spooler

This will clear all of your print jobs stuck in a queue.

#### Option 3: Create a Bat file for permanent use

 If you don’t want to go through all the trouble again, there’s a permanent fix for you to do this. Create your own batch file and you just need to open it every time you want to clear the print queue. Here is how to do it:

1. Open Notepad or Notepad++ (but not a word processor like Microsoft Word.)
2. Enter the following lines:  
 **net stop spooler**  
 **del %systemroot%\\System32\\spool\\printers\* /Q /F /S**  
 **net start spooler**

   * Change the file type to**All files**  
   * Name your file whatever you want, but add a**.bat** suffix.  
   * Make sure the Encoding type is**ANSI** .  
   * Save the file. (Note where the file is saved.)

4. Double-click the batch file to clear the print queue anytime you want.

### Fix 2: Reinstall the printer driver

 If your print jobs still get stuck in a queue, the main cause is a wrong or outdated printer driver. So you should update your printer driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 There are two ways to update your printer driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Install the printer driver manually

 Printer manufacturers such as HP, Canon, Brother, Dell, and Epson keep releasing new printer drivers to fix bugs and improve performance. To get them, you can go to your printer manufacturer’s website (always in the Support or Download section) and download the latest driver and install it manually.

* HP:[HP software and Driver Downloads](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers)
* Canon:[Canon Drivers & Downloads](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/drivers-downloads)
* Brother:[Brother Driver Downloads](https://www.brother-usa.com/brother-support/driver-downloads)
* Dell:[Dell Drivers & Downloads](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fhome%2Fus%2Fen%2F04%3Fapp%3Ddrivers)
* Epson:[Epson Products & Drivers](https://global.epson.com/products%5Fand%5Fdrivers/)

#### Option 2: Automatic printer driver update (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device.

**All the drivers in Driver Easy** **come straight from** **the manufacturer** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
