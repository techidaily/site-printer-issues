## Successful Repair: HP Networking Issue Ended

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59daec675e6cd.png)

**Printer not printing** is a common issue for HP printer users. This issue can result from various reasons, from connectivity issues to faulty configurations or drivers. If you are struggling to find a good fix, you can give the methods as follows a try. They can help you fix your HP printer won’t print problem.

1. **[Perform basic troubleshooting](#basics)**
2. **[Update printer driver](#d)**
3. **[Set your printer as default](#b)**
4. **[Cancel all print jobs](#c)**
5. **[Check printer status](#e)**
6. [**Repair corrupted system files**](#RE)

## Fix 1: Perform basic troubleshooting

 You can do some troubleshooting at first when you find your HP printer stops working. You should check the status of the**connection** between your printer and your computer. Make sure your devices are**properly connected** with each other, and the**network** or the**cable** you use to connect these devices is normal.

 You can also try restarting your HP printer.**Turn** it**off** completely and**unplug the power cord** , leave it for a couple of minutes, and then**plug** the cord**back** and**power on** the printer. See if your printer can print as normally as before.

## Fix 2: Update or reinstall the printer driver

 In many cases, the printer won’t print issue comes from faulty drivers. You may need to update or reinstall the printer driver to fix your HP printer, not the printing issue.

 One easy and credible way to deal with drivers is to use [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade.

4. After updating, restart your computer to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](mailto:support@drivereasy.com) .**

## Fix 3: Set your printer as default

 When you are trying to print something, your computer will automatically assign these printing tasks to the default printer unless you choose another one on purpose. So your HP printer won’t do its job if you neither set it as the default printer nor select it as the printer to print.

 If you want to set your HP printer as default, please follow the steps below.

1. Press the Window logo key and R key on your keyboard at the same time to open the Run dialog. In this dialog, type “control” and hit Enter. This will open the Control Panel.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_593fb867beb0b.png)
2. In Control Panel select**Devices and Printers** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_593fb89b62ded.png)
3. In the**Printers** section, right-click on your HP printer and then select**Set as default printer** . Click on**Yes** if prompted.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5987e5476a01d.png)
4. There is now a tick below the icon of your HP printer. That means it is now set as the default printer.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5987e5fe2a9b6.png)

## Fix 4: Cancel all print jobs

 Another possible cause of your HP printer not printing issue is the stuck print queue. The print queue containing failed print jobs can stop functioning normally and lead to the printer not printing issues. You can clear all print jobs to get your HP printer back to normal.

1. Open **Devices and Printers**  in the Control Panel. (You can refer to [**steps a and b**](#f) in the method above.)  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_593fb89b62ded.png)
2. Right-click on your HP printer in the**Printers** section and select**See what’s printing** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5987e955d3a5d.png)
3. Open the**Printer** menu and then select**Open As Administrator** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5987ea27610b0.png)
4. Open**Printer** menu again. This time select**Cancel All Documents** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5987ea70940b1.png)
5. **Confirm** your action.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_5987eaa0030f9.png)
6. You have canceled all print jobs of your printer. Now check and see if it can run normally.

## Fix 5: Check printer status

 If you have tried the methods above and your HP printer still cannot print, you may need to check if there are hardware issues on your printer.

 You need to ensure your HP printer has**enough** **paper, ink, or toner** , and it is**not stuck in a paper jam** . Also, check the status of your printer cartridge and try replacing it with a new one if it is not good enough. In some cases, your HP printer stops printing after you replace its parts. If this happens you should**install the original ones back** and see if the problem is resolved.

## Fix 6: Repair system files

 Your **HP won’t print**  problem is probably being caused by other issues related to your OS. The steps above may resolve it, but if they don’t, you should run a Windows repair to repair possible system file problems.

There are two ways you can run a system repair:

1. [**Repair & replace corrupted system files with Fortect**](#REIMAGE)
2. [**Run SFC scan**](#SFC)

#### Repair & replace corrupted system files with Fortect

[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is an all-in-one system solution. It scans your PC’s operating system for viruses, flags dangerous websites, frees up precious disk space, and replaces any problematic files found with new healthy ones. Running a system repair with Fortect is like a clean reinstall of your operating system, and all personal user data, programs, and settings will remain intact.

Here’s how to use Fortect to repair system files on your PC:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and run a scan on your PC. The process might take a couple of minutes.
3. Once the scan finishes, you will get a summary of the issues found on your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fortectstartrepair.png)
4. If you need to proceed with the repair function, you’ll be required to purchase the full version.
5. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 The full version of Fortect comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee and full customer support. If you run into any problems while using Fortect, or if it doesn’t work for you, don’t hesitate to contact their support team.

Check your computer to see if your printer works properly.

#### Run SFC scan

**System File Checker** (**SFC**) is a handy feature in Windows that helps scan your system files and repair missing or corrupted system files(including those related to **BSOD**). To **run the SFC scan** :

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and type cmd. Then right-click on **Command Prompt** and select **Run as administrator** .  
![how to open Command Prompt as an admin](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-Command-Prompt-Run-as-administrator.jpg)
2. Click**Yes** when prompted to confirm.
3. In the command prompt window, type**sfc /scannow** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sfc-scannow.jpg)  
 It’ll take some time for the SFC to replace the corrupted system files with new ones if it detects any, so please be patient.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Check your computer to see if the printer works properly.
