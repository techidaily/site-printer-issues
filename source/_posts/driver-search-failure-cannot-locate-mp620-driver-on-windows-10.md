## [Driver Search Failure] Cannot Locate MP620 Driver on Windows 10

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/canon-pixma-mo620.jpg)  If you want to update the printer driver for your Cannon MP620, but only find that Windows tells you “   **The best driver software for your device is already installed** .”, you’re not alone.

This notification basically means that Windows 10 fail to find your Canon MP620 driver from its database, so it is time you did it yourself: 1) Go to [**support website**](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support) of Canon. Enter the model name of your printer and then click **Go**.

 2) In the support website, drag down a little bit to 1) locate the**Driver & Downloads** button, 2) choose your operating system and 3) click the**Drivers** button.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pixma-mp620-driver-download-600x375.jpg) Canon has not yet released the printer driver for Windows 10 operating system, so we download the one for**Windows 8.1**instead. 3) Right-click the setup file and click **Properties**. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/properties-setup.jpg) 4) Go to**Compatibility**tab, then check the box for **Run this program in compatibility for:**and select **Windows 8**from the drop-down menu. Click**Apply**and**OK**to save.

5) Now install the setup as you install other setup files. After the installation, restart your computer and your printer for the changes to take effect. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee): 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now**button.
