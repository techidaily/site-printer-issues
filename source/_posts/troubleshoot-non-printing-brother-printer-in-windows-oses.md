## Fix 4 – Update your printer driver

 A range of printer-related problems is caused by a wrong or out-of-date printer driver.

 Brother keeps updating drivers for its printers.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update the printer driver
