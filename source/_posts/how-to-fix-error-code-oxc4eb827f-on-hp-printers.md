### Fix 1: Update your printer driver

 This problem may occur if you’re using the wrong printer driver or it’s out of date. To keep your printer running smoothly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct driver at all times. There are two ways you can update your printer driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#a1)** – Updating drivers manually requires computer skills and patience. You need to find the correct driver online, download it, and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#a2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 HP regularly updates printer drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[HP support website](https://support.hp.com/us-en)**  , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your printer driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 3: Check your ink cartridges and printhead

 This error could also indicate defective hardware on your device. There are 2 things you should check on your printer: ink cartridges and printhead.

 Consult your manual if you’re unsure how to uninstall your ink cartridges and printhead. If you’re not comfortable, take your printer to a repair shop for professional help.

* **[Check ink cartridges](#c1)**
* **[Check your printhead](#c2)**

#### **Check ink cartridges**

**Check whether your ink cartridges are clogged.**

 Blocked or clogged ink cartridges can cause the printer error B200\. To see if that’s the problem for you, you can clean your ink cartridges from the printer control panel or clean it manually.

**Check the ink levels on your printer.**

 Check the ink levels on your Canon printer and replace your cartridges if necessary.

**Remove and reinstall your cartridges.**

 Defective or disconnected cartridges may also be the reason why your printer keeps showing the error code.

 Remove your cartridges to check if any of them are defective. If you find any damaged cartridges, replace it.
