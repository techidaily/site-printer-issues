## Step 2: Install the printer driver for your HP printer

 Insert your printer driver CD that came with the your HP printer and run the printer setup application (usually “setup.exe”) to install the driver for your HP printer.

 If you lose your printer driver CD, don’t worry, you can download **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to help you install the latest driver for your HP printer.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click **Update**  next to your HP printer to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** ).
