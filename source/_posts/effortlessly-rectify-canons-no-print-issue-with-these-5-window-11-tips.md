If your problem persists, try the fixes below.

1. **[Check the connection status](#fix1)**
2. **[Temporarily disable the firewall](#fix2)**
3. **[Update your printer driver](#fix3)**
4. **[Set Canon as the default printer](#fix4)**
5. **[Delete print jobs from the print queue](#fix5)**

## Fix 1: Check the connection status

 Difficulty printing from your PC can occur for various reasons. The most common reason is because the connection between the computer and the machine is lost. So before heading into the more complicated fixes, you need to take some basic troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue.

 First off, you need to verify the machine is powered on and there are no errors. If the Status LED is not lit, then your machine is not powered on. Verify that it’s plugged into a working outlet and that any power switches are turned to the ON position. After you’ve confirmed that the machine is perfectly powered on but the printer still won’t printer, take more steps to check the connection status as follows:

**When you use a wired printer**

* If you connect the printer to your computer via a USB cable, check whether the cable is properly connected. If it isn’t, re-plug it and make sure they are properly seated into the ports on both your printer and your computer.
* Try another USB port on your computer in case the one you previously used is broken.

**When you use a wireless printer** :

 For users with a wireless Canon printer, it’s essential to confirm the printer has a secure connection between your machine and the router.

If your printer is still not working properly, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Temporarily disable the firewall

 Firewall software helps block threats from outside your network, but some settings or configurations can block communication with your printer and may reject the connection needed for your machine to work properly. To resolve this, disable the firewall from your computer and try to print again.

**To turn off Windows Firewall:**

 1) In the Search bar, type**windows defender firewall** . Then click**Windows Defender Firewall** from the results.

## Fix 3: Update your printer driver

 After connecting your Canon printer to Windows, to ensure it works properly, you need to install a proper driver. But if your printer driver is faulted or outdated, issues like printer not printing will arise. So if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your printer driver, do it now as it may fix your issue right away.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your printer driver:[manually](#option1) and [automatically](#option2) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Manually update your printer driver

 Canon’s website is available to download Canon product drivers. You can go to their website to find and download the driver you need. Below, you’ll find out how to download and install the driver from the official website.

 Since Canon has several official websites like [Canon UK](https://www.canon.co.uk/) ,[Canon USA](https://www.usa.canon.com/) ,[Canon Europe](https://www.canon-europe.com/) , etc., they may not share the same model. So you can use the browser to search for the specific driver directly. Or you can go to the Support Center, enter the model of your device in the search field, and follow the instructions to download and install the driver.

### Option 2: Automatically update your printer driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

Here’s how you can update your drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

![update drivers automatically with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy-1.png)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

## Fix 4: Set Canon as the default printer

 When you’re trying to print something, your computer will automatically assign these printing tasks to the default printer unless you choose another one on purpose. So your printer will not be working if you neither set it as a default option to print nor select it as the dedicated printer.

 To set up your Canon printer as the default printer, you can take these steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **control** in the field and press**Enter** to open the Control Panel.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-Control-Panel.png)

 3) Select **Small icons** from the drop-down menu next to **View by** . Then, click **Devices and Printers** .

## Fix 5: Delete print jobs from the print queue
