 You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

### Fix 1: Restart your printer

 A restart wipes away any code that’s stuck in a misbehaving state. So if you haven’t done so, try this easy fix first to see if it resolves the issue:

**1)** Press the**power button** on your printer to shut it down.

**2)** Unplug the printer power cable and wait for**3 minutes** .

**3)** Plug the power cable back into the power outlet.

**4)** Restart your printer and try printing a page.

If the printed output is still missing ink, try the next fix.

 The following process may vary depending on different types of printers. If you don’t know how to do it, consult your printer manual for instructions.

### Fix 2: Check your ink cartridges

 Most printer issues occur when the cartridges installed are not working correctly. To see if that’s the problem for you, follow the instructions below:

#### Ensure ink cartridges are not empty

 Your printer might not be able to produce a printout when the ink level is too low. So you need to check the ink/toner levels to ensure that there’s enough ink for it to work. Or, you’ll need to replace the cartridges.

#### Rule out ink cartridges clogging

 Over time, the ink hardens up and starts to clog the nozzles. The blocked or clogged ink cartridge can prevent your printer from printing properly. In this case, you can clean your ink cartridges from the printer control panel or clean them manually.

#### **Check for incorrect cartridge installation**

 Defective or disconnected cartridges will prevent your printer from working properly.

 To see if that’s the problem for you, remove your cartridges to check if any of them are defective. If you find any damaged cartridges, replace them.

If all your cartridges are in good condition, reinstall your cartridges.

 Make sure your cartridges all work properly, then try printing a page. If your printer still won’t print, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your printer driver

 Printer problems are likely to occur when the printer driver isn’t installed correctly on your PC, or it gets corrupted somehow. To fix it, try installing the latest driver for your printer. There are two ways you can get the right driver:

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your printer keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to your printer manufacturer’s website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update**  your printer **driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
