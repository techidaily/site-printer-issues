**If you are using a network printer:**

* Check your network connection as well as your network devices like your router and modem.
* View the network connection status of your printer and see if your printer is properly connected to the network.
* Reconnect or replace your network cable when necessary if your printer is using wired connection.
* For wireless printer, try reconnecting your printer to your home or work network.

 You may need to consult your printer manual for instructions when reconnecting your network printer.

**If you connect your printer via Bluetooth:**

* Make sure your printer is close enough to your computer.
* Try re-pairing your printer with your computer and see if this solves your problem.

 Check your printer manual for information about how to re-pair your printer and your computer.

 If it does, great! But if not, there are three more fixes for you to try…

## Method 5: Clear all print jobs

 You can’t use your Epson printer if the print queue of your printer gets stuck. In this case, you need to clear your print queue so you can use your printer.

 **What are print jobs?**
 When you try to print a file, your computer will place this task as a print job in the print queue (a queue of print jobs that is going to be printed) of your printer on your computer. Sometimes a print job in the queue gets stuck and stops the other print jobs in the queue from being printed.

To clear your print jobs:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type “_**services.msc**_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Services window.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f1bc9808a1b.png)
2. Double click**Print Spooler** .  

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f29629de1e9.jpg)
3. Click**Stop** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a1317d8a2.png)
4. Minimize the Services window. Then open**File Explorer** (on your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E**  at the same time).  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a36c12e67.jpg)
5. Copy and paste the address**`%windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS`** to the address bar and press**Enter** on your keyboard to go to where the print jobs are stored.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a48b237b4.jpg)
6. Delete all the files in this folder.

## Method 6: Use another program to print your document
