 3) Go to the **[Canon Support](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support)**  page to download the latest driver for your printer model, and follow the on-screen instructions to install the file.

 Downloading the driver from the Canon website is direct and straightforward though, it could be really time-consuming.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks and you get full support and a**30-day money back** guarantee.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
