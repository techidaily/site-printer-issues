## Fix 3 – Restart the Print Spooler service

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-1.jpg)

3. After the Print Spooler service is restarted, right-click**Print Spooler** again and click**Properties** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-3-2.jpg)
4. Set the**Startup type** to**Automatic** . Then, click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-4.jpg)
