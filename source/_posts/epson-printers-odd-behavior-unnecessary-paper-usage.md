## Epson Printer's Odd Behavior: Unnecessary Paper Usage

 You’ll feel so weird when your Epson printer suddenly prints blanks. You might say: It had been working great since you got it. Don’t worry, it can be easy to fix.

## Check your Device

1. Make sure your printer is placed on a flat stable surface.
2. [Check your ink cartridges.](#f1)
3. Make sure you’re using supported paper.  
**Note** : Transparencies and vellum paper are not supported.
4. Make sure your document doesn’t have blank pages.
5. Make sure the paper size, orientation, and layout settings in your software are correct.

## Fixes for Epson Printer Printing Blank Pages

 You may not need to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Check your ink cartridges](#f1)
2. [Clean your clogged Nozzles](#f2)
3. [Update your printer driver](#f3)
4. [Install Fortect](#f4)

### Fix 1: Check your ink cartridges

 There are**three situations** in checking your ink cartridges.

 The first and most common condition is**your ink level is low** . You can simply replace it to solve the problem.

 The second situation is that**one of your ink cartridges is out of ink** . There is a sentence in the Epson manual which most people might ignore: **You cannot print or copy when an ink cartridge is expended even if the other cartridges are not expended.** If one of your cartridges is expended, you should replace it with a new one. Otherwise, you may encounter the printing blank pages issue.

 The third condition is that you’ve replaced a new ink cartridge but**you forget to remove the protective tape** . New cartridges have protective tape. Not only that it keep the ink from leaking, but it actually protects the print nozzles of sensitive ink cartridges. But you should be careful with the additional transparent plastic or a pointed mechanism, do not remove it or your cartridge will leak or malfunction.

### Fix 2: Clean your clogged Nozzles

 If you haven’t been using your printer for a long time or you ignore the low ink warning but keep using the printer, your nozzle may clog and cause the printing blank problem. Epson printer has a built-in feature to clean nozzles in one or two cycles, you can use it to solve the problem.  
 Before you start, make sure the printer’s LCD screen isn’t showing any errors, then follow the below steps:

1. Press the**Home** button on the printer and select**Setup** , then move to**Maintenances** .
2. Select**Printhead Nozzle Check** .
3. Your printer will start checking by produce a page with four colored grids designed to illustrate which nozzles are blocked.
4. If there are gaps or some lines are faint, select**Clean the printhead** and continue.  
**Note** : Don’t turn off your printer when it’s doing a cleaning cycle. Otherwise, your printer will be damaged.

 If your printer is under warranty and you didn’t see any improvements after cleaning, you can contact Epson for further instructions. But if you are no longer under warranty, you can clean the nozzle manually.

**Note** : This Printhead Cleaning Cycles cannot be used too often. Allow your printer to rest for at least 6 hours after one cycle (recommended by Epson), then go through a cleaning cycle again. Doing this program repeatedly will make your clog worse and use a lot of ink.

### Fix 3: Update your printer driver

 Epson printer needs drivers to work properly. If the driver is outdated or wrong, it may cause problems. There are two ways to get the correct driver: manually and automatically.
