### If you’re using a USB printer

 If you connect the printer to your computer via a USB cable, simply re-plug it and also try another USB port on your computer in case the one you previously used is broken.

## Fix 2 – Set your Brother printer as the default device

 Your computer tends to use the default printer every time you print. Therefore, you should set your Brother printer as the default device to undertake all the print jobs. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Type**control** in the field and click**OK** .

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-4.jpg)

 Now do some prints to test if this method helps. If yes, then congrats! If not, there’re more fixes to try.

---

## Fix 3 – Restart the Print Spooler service

 Your computer won’t send the print jobs to your Brother printer if the Print Spooler service is not working properly. To get your printer back to running, you can simply restart this service.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to open the Run box. Type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-1.jpg)
2. Right-click**Print Spooler** . If it isn’t running,**Start** this service; if it’s already started, click**Restart** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-2.jpg)
3. After the Print Spooler service is restarted, right-click**Print Spooler** again and click**Properties** .

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-4.jpg)

## Fix 4 – Update your printer driver

 A range of printer-related problems is caused by a wrong or out-of-date printer driver. So if you’re troubled by the non-working Brother printer, be sure to update its driver and see if the problem gets resolved. There’re two options for you:**[manually](#option1)** or**[automatically](#option2)** .

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Brother keeps updating drivers for its printers. You can search for the latest driver on **[Brother’s support website](https://support.brother.com/g/b/productsearch.aspx?c=us%5Fot&lang=en&content=dl)**  , find the one corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download it.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update the printer driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.
