![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b51a9a192869.png)

 If your**printer is not connecting to your computer** , don’t worry. You can fix the**printer not connected issues** easily with the solutions in this article.

 Why isn’t my printer connecting to my computer? The causes are various. It’s likely that your USB cable is damaged or your printer’s not detected by your computer. Maybe there’s something wrong with your printer driver. Whether you’re getting the printer not connected issue suddenly or it has never worked over the network, you can try the following solutions to fix your problem.

## Try these fixes

1. [Check the printer connection](#Fix1)
2. [Update your printer driver](#Fix2)
3. [Troubleshoot printer issues](#Fix3)
4. [Restart Print Spooler service](#Fix4)

**Note** : before getting started, ensure that your printer’s hardware works properly. If there’s an issue with your printer itself, try contacting your printer manufacturer.

### Fix 1: Check the printer connection

#### 1\. Restart your printer

 Power off and then power on your printer to restart it. Wait for a while for it to be fully ready.

#### 2\. Check the connection issue

 If your printer is connected by the USB cable, ensure the cable is not damaged, and it connects firmly and correctly. Also, check the USB port and clean the ports in case something inside the port is preventing your USB from connecting.

 If your printer is connected via a wireless network or Bluetooth, follow the manual delivered with your device to connect your printer to WiFi or Bluetooth properly.

 As this varies from manufacturer and printer, for example, the operations vary from HP printers to Brother printers, so we won’t cover it here and you should follow the product manual.

#### 3\. Check the network connection

 As the network issues can also cause your printer not connected, you should also make sure your Internet connection works when you’re using your printer.

### Fix 2: Update your printer driver

 The missing or outdated printer driver can lead to your printer not connected issue, so you should verify that your printer driver is up to date.

 Updating your printer driver to the latest version can not only resolve any possible printer issues, like printer not printing, printer error, etc but also bring you the best possible experience.

 There are two ways to update your printer driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually** : you can manually download the printer driver from the manufacturer, and install it in your computer. Ensure to download the latest correct version that’s compatible with your Windows system. As this varies from manufacturer and printer models, we won’t cover it here.

**Automatically** : if you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee**):

### Fix 4: Restart the Print Spooler Service

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type**services.msc** and click**OK** .

 3) Scroll down and find the**Print Spooler** service.

 4) If the service is running, right-click on the service and select**Stop** , then right-click on the service and click**Start** to restart the service.

 If the service isn’t running properly, right-click on the service and click**Start** to run the service.
