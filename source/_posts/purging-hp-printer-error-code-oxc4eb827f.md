 The error code**OXC4EB827F** commonly occurs due to incompatible drivers, connection errors, and defective hardware. But before taking your printer to a repair store for professional help, try the solutions provided here.

## Fixes to try

 Here are three solutions that have proven helpful for many HP users. You may not need to try them all—simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Update your printer driver](#a)**
2. **[Reconnect your printer to your computer](#b)**
3. **[Check your ink cartridges and printhead](#c)**

### Fix 1: Update your printer driver

 This problem may occur if you’re using the wrong printer driver or it’s out of date. To keep your printer running smoothly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct driver at all times. There are two ways you can update your printer driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#a1)** – Updating drivers manually requires computer skills and patience. You need to find the correct driver online, download it, and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#a2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 HP regularly updates printer drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[HP support website](https://support.hp.com/us-en)**  , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your printer driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 Consult your manual if you’re unsure how to uninstall your ink cartridges and printhead. If you’re not comfortable, take your printer to a repair shop for professional help.

* **[Check ink cartridges](#c1)**

**Check the ink levels on your printer.**
