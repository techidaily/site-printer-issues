### Fix 1: Update your printer driver

 When something goes wrong with your Canon printer, updating its driver should always be your go-to option. Most printer issues, such as blank page printing, error code messages, and printer not responding, are often caused by a faulty printer driver.

There are two ways you can update your printer driver:

* **[Option 1 – Manually install the driver](#a1)** [](#a1)
* **[Option 2 – Automatically update your printer driver (Recommended)](#a2)**

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating printer drivers. Here’s how to get the latest correct one for your device:

**1)** Go to the **[Canon support website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support)**  , then click**SUPPORT > SOFTWARE & DRIVERS** .

**4)** Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 The following process may vary depending on different types of printers. If you don’t know how to do it, consult your printer manual for instructions.

#### Check whether your ink cartridges are clogged

 Blocked or clogged ink cartridges can cause the printer error B200\. To see if that’s the problem for you, you can clean your ink cartridges from the printer control panel or clean them manually.

#### Check the ink levels on your printer
