## Canon Printer: Unresponsive, Seek Help Fast

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b029e969cb42-300x164.jpg)

 Many Canon printer users are having a not responding issue with their printer. Their Canon printer isn’t responsive or displays a “printer not responding” error when they attempt to print something.

 This is very frustrating. You can’t print any document with your Canon printer because of this issue. But don’t worry. It can be fixed…

## Fixes to try

 The following are a few methods that have helped many Canon printer users. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Do some basic troubleshooting**](#a)
2. [**Run the printer troubleshooter**](#b)
3. [**Restart the Print Spooler service**](#c)
4. [**Configure the correct printer port for your printer**](#d)
5. [**Update your printer driver**](#e)

### Method 1: Do some basic troubleshooting

 Your Canon printer may not be connected to your connection properly. So it’s worth checking the connection of your printer.

**If you are using a USB cable to connect your printer:**

* Check if the cable is properly connected. If it isn’t, reconnect the cable and make sure they are properly seated into the ports on both your printer and your computer.
* Connect your printer directly to your computer without using a hub.
* Try connecting the cable to another USB port on your computer and see if this works for you.
* You may also need to experiment with another cable and see if there is any problem with the cable you’re using.

**If you are using a network printer:**

* Check your network connection as well as your network devices like your router and modem.
* View the network connection status of your printer and see if your printer is properly connected to the network.
* Reconnect or replace your network cable when necessary if your printer is using a wired connection.
* For wireless printer, try reconnecting your printer to your home or work network.

 You may need to consult your printer manual for instructions when reconnecting your network printer.

**If you connect your printer via Bluetooth:**

* Make sure your printer is close enough to your computer.
* Try re-pairing your printer with your computer and see if this solves your problem.

 Check your printer manual for information about how to re-pair your printer and your computer.

### Method 2: Run the printer troubleshooter

 The Windows built-in troubleshooter can check your Canon printer and fix its issues. To run the printer troubleshooter:

#### on Windows 10

**1)**  Press the **Windows logo key** , then type “_**troubleshoot**_ “. Click **Troubleshoot** or**Troubleshooting** in the results.

 Hopefully this will fix your printer. But if not, there are three more fixes for you to try…

### Method 3: Restart the Print Spooler service

 The Print Spooler service on your computer manages your print jobs and the communication between your printer and computer. Your Canon printer may not be responding because this service on your computer is not working properly. You should reset this service to see if this fixes your printer.

To reset this service:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f05e61151ac.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

**2)** Type “_**services.msc**_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Services window.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b320bb1ea13a.jpg)

**4)** Check to see if your printer is able to print.

### Method 4: Configure the correct printer port for your printer

 Your Canon may not be responding because you’re using the wrong port for your printer. To change the settings of your printer port:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f05e61151ac.png) and **R**  on your keyboard at the same time to invoke the Run box.

**2)**  Type “_**control**_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard.

**3)** Under**View by** , select**Large icons** .

**4)** Click**Devices and Printers** .

**6)** Click**Change Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b321538f2ef1.jpg)

**7)** Click the**Port** tab, then check the port that:

* Contains the name of your printer;
* Has “**USB** ” or “**DOT4** ” in the_description_ if you connect your printer with USB;
* Has “**WSD** “, “**network** ” or “**IP** ” in the_description_ if you are using a network printer.

 After that, click**Apply** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b32194502079.jpg)

**8)** Click the**General** tab, then click**Print Test Page** to check you’ve made the right change.

 If you haven’t, repeat step 7 and 8 until your printer is working properly.

### Method 5: Update your printer driver

 Your printer may not be responding because you’re using the wrong printer driver or it’s out of date. To see if that’s the case for you, you should update your Canon printer driver. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either the Free or Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes only 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back**guarantee**):

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .

**2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b02a3b249666.jpg)

**3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to_your Canon printer_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can install it. You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b02a3d8e2197.jpg)

 You can do it for free, but it’s partly manual.
