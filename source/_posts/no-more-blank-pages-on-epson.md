 You may need to consult your printer manual for instructions when reconnecting your network printer.

**If you connect your printer via Bluetooth:**

* Make sure your printer is close enough to your computer.
* Try re-pairing your printer with your computer and see if this solves your problem.

 Check your printer manual for information about how to re-pair your printer and your computer.

6. Check to see if your Epson printer is able to print now.

## Method 5: Clear all print jobs

 You can’t use your Epson printer if the print queue of your printer gets stuck. In this case, you need to clear your print queue so you can use your printer.

 **What are print jobs?**
 When you try to print a file, your computer will place this task as a print job in the print queue (a queue of print jobs that is going to be printed) of your printer on your computer. Sometimes a print job in the queue gets stuck and stops the other print jobs in the queue from being printed.

To clear your print jobs:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type “_**services.msc**_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Services window.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f1bc9808a1b.png)
2. Double click**Print Spooler** .

10. Turn off your printer and unplug the power cable from it.

## Method 6: Use another program to print your document

## Method 7: Check the status of your printer

4. If you are experiencing any issue you can’t resolve yourself, contact the customer support of Epson or bring it to an authorized service provider to**have it serviced** .
