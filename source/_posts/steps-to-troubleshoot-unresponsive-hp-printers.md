## Steps to Troubleshoot Unresponsive HP Printers

 What to do when your HP printer not responding? This usually caused by an incompatible driver. The printer driver is either outdated or corrupted, thus stopping you from printing normally.

 It can also be your Printer Spooler service, and you might need to restart the service for it to work again. In this post, we’ll walk you through the steps to fix the issue.

## Try these fixes

1. [**Restart the Print Spooler service**](#method-1)
2. [**Reinstall the printer driver**](#method-2)
3. [**Use the generic driver**](#method-2)
4. **[Use the Windows Troubleshooter](#method-4)**

### Method 1\. Restart the Print Spooler service

 Your HP printer may not be responding because the Print Spooler Service on your computer is not working properly. To fix it, you’ll need to restart the service:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + R** key and enter**services.msc** in the Run box.

3) Check if your HP printer is able to print now.

### Method 2\. Reinstall the printer driver

 When the HP printer is not responding, you can fix it easily by reinstalling the printer driver. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + R** and enter**devmgmt.msc** .

 8) Once the printer is ready for use, the printer driver not available error should be solved. You can print a test page to check if this issue persists.

If this method doesn’t do the trick, you can try the fix below.

### Method 3\. Use the generic driver

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + R** and enter**devmgmt.msc** .

![devmgmt.msc](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/devmgmt.msc_.jpg)

 3) Select**Browse my computer for drivers** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browse-my-computer.jpg)

 4) Choose**Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer** .

 5) Select**Generic printer device** , and click**Nex** t to continue.

 6) Now the driver should be updated to the generic device now. You can check the status of the printer. If you’re still having the HP printer not responding problem, you can perform a Windows Update or try the Windows built-in troubleshooter, below.

### Method 4\. Use the Windows Troubleshooter

 If the methods above fail to solve your HP printer not responding issue, you can let Windows find the real problem for you. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Win + R** key, and enter**control** in the Run box.
