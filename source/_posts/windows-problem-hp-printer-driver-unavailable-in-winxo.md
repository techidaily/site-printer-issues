### Fix 2 – Reinstall your printer driver

 The HP printer driver unavailable error usually indicates your printer is missing, corrupt or not recognized by the computer.

### Fix 3 – Check if your system is corrupted

 If none of the methods above works, there might be something wrong with your system. Corrupted or damaged system files can trigger various printer issues including the printer driver error. To identify the cause and fix it, you can use **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do a full Windows scan and repair.

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a powerful tool for Windows repair and optimization. By comparing your system to a healthy one, it can repair missing or damaged system files, detect privacy vulnerabilities, and remove potential malware and viruses on your computer. It’s much like a fresh reinstallation of Windows, but keeps your programs, user data, and settings as they are.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.
