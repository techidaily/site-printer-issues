 If you are a printer user, it is possible that you have encountered a**Printer in Error State** issue. If you come across one, an error message will pop up on your computer telling you your printer “**is in an error state** “. Your printer cannot get to work at this time.

## 1) Check the connection and restart your devices

 Once your printer is in an error state, you can perform some simple methods and see if they work.

 You can check whether the**connection between your printer and computer** functions normally. Make sure your devices**connect to each other** properly, and the**network** (either wireless or Bluetooth) or**cable** you use for the connection has no problem.
