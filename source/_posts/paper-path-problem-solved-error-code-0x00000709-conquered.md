 Many Windows users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix. Here are 2 methods for you to try.

## Fix 1: Fix registry glitches automatically

 The following screenshots are shown on Windows 7, but the fixes apply to Windows 10 and Windows 8 as well.

 After setting up your printer, you will need to update your printer driver for it to work more smoothly.

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the printer driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click _**Update All**_  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
