### Fix 1: Check the network connection

 The network connection is necessary but easily neglected. When your printer does not show up on the PC, you should check the network connection first. Once you find the network is disconnected, you need to reconnect it.

#### Step 1: Run a ping command

1. Click the**Search** box, and then type**cmd** . Click**Command Prompt** .

2. Find out the**IP address** on your printer information tag.
3. Type**ping** and then**IP address** (eg. ping 10.26.76.249) on the Command Prompt dialog and press**Enter** . Note that**a space** is necessary between the ping command and the IP address.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-28_10-58-4011111-1.png)
4. Your PC will perform the ping command and detect if your printer is connected to the network.

#### Step 2: Reconnect the printer

 If your printer is not connected to the network, you can reconnect the printer. Since this varies from manufacturer to printer, you can refer to your printer manual for instructions or consult the service personnel on the printer website.

 If your printer has been connected but it still doesn’t show up on the PC, you can move to the next method.

### Fix 3: Update your printer drivers

 When your Windows updates but your printer driver doesn’t, your printer may be not compatible with your Windows version. It can cause a series of problems, including your printer not showing up on the PC. Therefore, you can try to update your printer drivers in two ways to fix the problem.

#### **Option 1- Manually download and install the driver**

 You can update your print driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. It will take time and effort.

#### **Option 2- Automatically update the driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and then find the correct drivers for it. In other words, You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and then click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any drivers that need to update.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-15_15-08-24-2.jpg)
3. You can choose to update the driver with a FREE version. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.  
 Or you can click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-25_17-36-56.jpg)

 After updating your device drivers, see if your network printer shows up. If not, move to the next method.

### Fix 4: Enable the Print Spooler service

 The**Printer Spooler** service is responsible for managing all printing jobs. That is, if the service is disabled, it will cause a series of printer problems. So when your network printer is not visible on the PC, you can try to check the print spooler service and enable it.

1. Press the**Windows** logo key and**R** key on keyboard at the same time to open the**Run** dialog.
2. Type**services.msc** and then press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-28_09-01-23.jpg)
3. Slide down your mouse until you find the**Printer Spooler** . Double click the**Printer Spooler** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-25_14-54-08.jpg)

### Fix 5: Run Printer Troubleshooter

2. Click the**Update and Security** from the menu options.
