## Fix 4 – Update your printer driver

 A range of printer-related problems is caused by a wrong or out-of-date printer driver. So if you’re troubled by the non-working Brother printer, be sure to update its driver and see if the problem gets resolved. There’re two options for you:**[manually](#option1)** or**[automatically](#option2)** .

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Brother keeps updating drivers for its printers. You can search for the latest driver on **[Brother’s support website](https://support.brother.com/g/b/productsearch.aspx?c=us%5Fot&lang=en&content=dl)**  , find the one corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download it.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update the printer driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.
