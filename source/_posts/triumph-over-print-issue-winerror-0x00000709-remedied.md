 Many Windows users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix. Here are 2 methods for you to try.

## Fix 1: Fix registry glitches automatically

 The Error 0x00000709 message is often caused by faulty Windows Registry settings. To see if this is the cause for you, run a system scan to detect broken system files with **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a professional Windows repair tool that can scan your system’s overall status, diagnose your system configuration, identify faulty system files, and repair them automatically.

 Here’s how to use Restoro to check for broken system components in just one click:

 1) [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect and run a free scan of your PC status. This may take a few minutes.

 3) You can review a summary of the issues detected after the scan is finished.

## Fix 2: Modify your registry key

**IMPORTANT:** Modifying the registry in your computer could cause irrecoverable errors if the modification is done incorrectly, therefore, you need to **[back up](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  your registry first.

 The following screenshots are shown on Windows 7, but the fixes apply to Windows 10 and Windows 8 as well.

 1) Click the **Start** button, then type **regedit** and press **Enter** .

 After setting up your printer, you will need to update your printer driver for it to work more smoothly.

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
