 2) Click**Yes** when prompted to confirm.

 3) In the command prompt window, type**sfc /scannow** and press **Enter** .

 It’ll take some time for the SFC to replace the corrupted system files with new ones if it detects any, so please be patient.

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Check your computer to see if the problem has been fixed. If yes, then congrats!
