 If you connect the printer to your computer via a USB cable, simply re-plug it and also try another USB port on your computer in case the one you previously used is broken.

### If you’re using a wireless printer

 For users with a wireless Brother printer, it’s essential to confirm the printer and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.

 If the Brother printer still doesn’t work, try the next method below.

## Fix 2 – Set your Brother printer as the default device

 Your computer tends to use the default printer every time you print. Therefore, you should set your Brother printer as the default device to undertake all the print jobs. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Type**control** in the field and click**OK** .

2. Select**Small icons** from the drop-down menu next to**View by** . Then, click**Devices and Printers** .  

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-2-2.jpg)
3. Right-click your**Brother printer** and click**Set as default printer** .

## Fix 4 – Update your printer driver

 A range of printer-related problems is caused by a wrong or out-of-date printer driver. So if you’re troubled by the non-working Brother printer, be sure to update its driver and see if the problem gets resolved. There’re two options for you:**[manually](#option1)** or**[automatically](#option2)** .

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Brother keeps updating drivers for its printers. You can search for the latest driver on **[Brother’s support website](https://support.brother.com/g/b/productsearch.aspx?c=us%5Fot&lang=en&content=dl)**  , find the one corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download it.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
