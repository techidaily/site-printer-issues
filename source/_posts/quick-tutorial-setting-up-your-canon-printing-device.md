## Quick Tutorial: Setting Up Your Canon Printing Device

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/featured-image-1.jpg)

 Have no idea about how to set up your new Canon printer? You’ve come to the right place. This post will guide you through the process of setting up a Canon printer, step by step.

## How to set up your Canon printer

Setting up your Canon printer is quite easy and takes only two steps:

1. **[Connect your Canon printer to the computer](#step1)**
2. **[Install the printer driver](#step2)**

### Step 1 – Connect your Canon printer to the computer

 To set up a Canon printer, the first thing is connecting it to the computer. And there are three ways you can do that:

* [**USB connection**](#option1)
* **[Wi-Fi connection](#option2)**
* **[Wired network connection](#option3)**

#### Connect your printer via a USB cable

 If you want to connect the printer to your computer directly and print only from that device, you could choose the USB connection.

 Simply plug one end of the cable into the USB port on the Canon printer and the other into the USB port on your computer. Then, plug in the power cable and turn on the printer.

 After connecting the printer with your computer, you can follow**[Step 2](#step2)** to install the printer driver.

#### Connect your printer via Wi-Fi

 If your printer is wireless-capable, you can easily connect it via Wi-Fi. In this way, your printer will be able to print from any devices connected to the same wireless network, including computers, laptops, tablets or cell phones.

**1)** Plug in the power supply and turn on the printer.

**2)** On the printer’s control panel, use the arrow key to select**Menu** , and then select**Network Settings** .

 The steps to configure the printer’s networking settings may vary on different printer models. For more details, you can refer to the manual of your printer.

#### Connect your printer via a wired network

 A wired connection allows multiple devices on a wired network to access the printer but requires the use of an Ethernet cable. You can connect your printer directly to the router as follow:

### Step 2 – Install the printer driver

 To let your Canon printer communicate properly with the computer, you’ll need to install the correct and up-to-date printer driver.

 If your computer automatically detects the printer, you could follow the on-screen instructions to install it. Otherwise, you’ll need to download and install the printer driver manually.

 You could directly insert the installation CD that comes with the Canon printer and launch the setup program. But if you don’t have the disc or if you lost it, here are 2 ways to get the printer drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#manually)**

**[Option2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#automatically)**

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Canon keeps updating the printer drivers. Follow the instruction below and you’ll learn how to get it from the official website.

**1)** Navigate to **[Canon’s support website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support)**  .

**2)** Enter your product model and select it from the search results.
