## Step 1: Connect your HP printer to your computer

1. [**USB connection to your computer**](#a)
2. [**Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection to your computer (a wireless-capable printer is needed)**](#b)
3. [**Wired connection to your computer**](#c)

### Method 1: USB connection to your computer

**1)** Turn on your computer and your HP printer.

**2)** Use a USB cable to connect the USB port on the rear of your HP printer and your computer.

### Method 2: Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection to your computer (a wireless-capable printer is needed)

If your HP printer is **wireless-capable**  , you can connect your printer to your network with the guided Wireless Setup Wizard on the printer.

**1)** Turn on your HP printer, router, and computer.

**2)** Remove any USB or Ethernet cables from your printer.

**3)** Make sure your computer is connected to the same wireless network you are connecting the printer to.

### Method 3: Wired connection to your computer

 You can also connect your HP printer and your computer to your router with a standard Ethernet cable.

**1)** Turn on your HP printer.

**2)**  Remove any plug from the Ethernet port (the port with the ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4eac2c5fcbd.png)  logo) on the rear of your printer.

## Step 2: Install the printer driver for your HP printer

 Insert your printer driver CD that came with the your HP printer and run the printer setup application (usually “setup.exe”) to install the driver for your HP printer.

 If you lose your printer driver CD, don’t worry, you can download **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to help you install the latest driver for your HP printer.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click **Update**  next to your HP printer to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** ).
