 If the troubleshooter can’t help you fix the issue, take a look at the next method.

### Fix 3:**Reinstall your printer driver**

 Drivers are a set of computer software that let your PC communicate with the hardware. Some users reported that this could be a driver issue that can be fixed by**reinstalling the printer driver** . You can use to following steps to reinstall the printer driver correctly:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the**Run box** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/just-a-run-box.jpg)
2. Type or paste**devmgmt.msc** . Then click**OK** to open Device Manager.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/device-manager-run-box-ok.jpg)
3. Click to expand the**Print queues** category. Right-click your printer and select**Uninstall device** . (If you can’t find your printer in Device Manager, you can [download Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to scan for missing drivers.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/device-manager-reinstall-printer-02.jpg)
4. Click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/device-manager-reinstall-printer-03.jpg)

 Usually Windows will install the missing printer driver automatically after a reboot. But if it doesn’t, you need to go to**your printer manufacturer’s website** and search for your printer model. Be sure to download the latest correct driver installer that’s compatible with your system. If you’re not familiar with computer drivers, you can use [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to**repair and update drivers automatically** .

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.
