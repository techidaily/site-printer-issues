## Fix 1: Perform basic troubleshooting

 When your printer only prints in black-and-white all of a sudden, the first thing you can do is performing some basic troubleshooting. Sometimes you’ll just need to replace the ink cartridge or adjust a setting, and your printer will work just fine. To perform basic troubleshooting, you can follow these steps:

* Make sure the document is set to print in color and enable the color printing feature on your printer.
* Check the ink level and replace the ink cartridge if necessary.
* Clean the print head. Most printers have an automatic cleaning feature now. If your printer doesn’t, you can try to manually clean it. Please refer to a guide while doing so.
* Make sure the printer is correctly connected to your device.
* Restart your printer and test the issue again.

## Fix 2: Try to print from a different device

 If you’ve tested the basics and everything seems just fine, then the problem may be with your PC. You can try to send the print job on another PC, your phone, or tablet, to see if can print your document in color.

 If it does, then you may need to [update your driver (see the next fix)](#fix3) . If your printer still won’t print in color, then it could be a hardware issue. Consider seeking help from a printer technician or replace your printer if it’s an old one.

## Fix 3: Update your printer driver

 A common cause for most printer issues is a faulty or outdated printer driver. When you’ve performed basic troubleshooting steps but your printer still won’t print in color, you may want to check the driver. You’d want to make sure your printer driver is up-to-date and functioning properly.

 There are two ways to keep your printer driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it via Device Manager. Just note that Windows doesn’t always give you the latest available update, and you may need to search on the manufacturer’s website. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Fix 4: Repair system files

 If the fixes above didn’t give you luck, you may be looking at a system-wide issue. Let’s say some of your system files or Windows services that are required for printing are corrupted. It could cause printer issues and thus your printer can have problems printing in color.

 To identify problematic system files, normally you can use the system checker tool (sfc /scannow). However, it doesn’t help much when it comes to printer issues, because printer issues are more likely triggered by malfunctioning Windows services.
