### Part 3: What to do if your printer is not working properly

 If your **Canon  printer**  acts a bit weird, say:

* error notifications pop up randomly
* it wonâ€™t even print at all, etc.

 chances are you have the outdated or corrupt printer driver. So you should update your printer driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.
