![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img_57971bf8a9ed1.png)

 “**Unable to install Printer.Operation could not be completed** ” could occur during installing printer or using the printer, especially after a Windows upgrade or reinstall. The problem can be caused by several issues. If you run into this problem, just try the **three**  solutions below and the problem should resolve.

## Solution**1: Start the Print Spooler service**

 The problem can occur if the print spooler service is stopped. So make sure the service is started. If it’s stopped, start it. To check and start the service, follow these steps:

1) Press **Win+R**  (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the Run box.

2) Type **services.msc** in the run box and click **OK** .

## **Solution 2: Update the printer driver**

 A faulty, corrupt or missing printer driver can caused “Unable to install Printer.Operation could not be completed” error. To resolve the issue, you can update the printer driver.
