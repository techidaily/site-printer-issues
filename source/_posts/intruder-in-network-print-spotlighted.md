### Solution 2 – Do a full power cycle

Another solution that works for many users is **turning the computer, printer, and Wi-Fi completely off and then on again**. Doing so may help reinitialize the configurations and parameters sets of your printer or recover it from an unresponsive state. It’s also used to reset all the network configurations as they are all lost when you turn the device completely off. So, you might as well give it a go:

1. )**Turn off** your computer, printer and Wi-Fi.
2. **Unplug**  your computer and printer.
3. After a period of about**5 minutes** ,**plug in** both devices, turn them on and try connecting and printing something.

You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

### Solution 4 – Set your printer as the default printer

If you’re using a Canon printer, setting your printer as the default printer in**Settings**may do the trick.

 Canon printers tend to have two printers listed in place of a single printer. One is a normal printer and the other has the same name but has a ‘WS’ at its end. If you are connected to the ‘WS’ printer, this may be causing the issue of “**Another computer is using the printer** “. Under such circumstances, all you need to do is simply**set the normal printer as the default printer** . Besides, you can remove the WS printer as it is not required.
