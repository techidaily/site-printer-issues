3. Scroll down the new page to the bottom and a list of printer drivers compatible with your operating system will be listed (**Windows 10** ,**x64** in my case). Click**the first result** to make sure you download the latest driver release. Then click**DOWNLOAD** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b03db3044199.jpg)

5. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect even if youâ€™re not asked to.
6. Skip this step if you can scan over a network/with a USB connection in your Windows system. But if you fail to do in either of them, you might need to go back to the download page to download & install a patch for it. Follow the prompts to so that the patch can solve the issue for you.
