### Fix 2 – Reinstall your printer driver

 The HP printer driver unavailable error usually indicates your printer is missing, corrupt or not recognized by the computer. You should just uninstall the current driver and install the latest correct printer driver. There are two ways for you to do so:**[manually](#option1)** or**[automatically (recommended)](#option2)** .

#### Option 1 – Reinstall the printer driver with Device Manager

 Device Manager is a Windows built-in tool that allows you to view and control the hardware attached to your computer and update the device drivers. Here’s how to use it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type**devmgmt.msc** and click **OK** .

2. Double-click**Printers** to expand that category.

3. Right-click your**HP printer** and select**Uninstall device** .

4. Tick**Delete the driver software for this device** and click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/device-manager-3.jpg)
5. Restart your computer to employ the changes, and Windows should install the correct driver for you.

 It’s easy to reinstall your HP printer driver via Device Manager, but it won’t always detect outdated drivers ([see why](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ). For an easier way to install the latest driver, check out Option 2.

#### Option 2 – Automatically reinstall the printer driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to reinstall the HP printer driver manually or if you want to get the latest printer driver, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
