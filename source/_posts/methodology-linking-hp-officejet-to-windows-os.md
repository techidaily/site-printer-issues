### Step 2: Install the printer driver for your printer

 Insert your printer driver CD that came with the your printer and run the printer setup application (usually “setup.exe”) to install the driver for your printer.

 If you lose your printer driver CD, or i f you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to install the printer driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
