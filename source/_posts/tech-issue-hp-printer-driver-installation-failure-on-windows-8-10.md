  The issue caused because the driver in the disk is too old to be compatible with your system. To install the driver successfully, first, you need to uninstall the older printer driver from your computer.

 You can follow these steps to uninstall the driver.

  1\. Press**Win+R** (Windows key and R key) at the same time. A Run dialog will appear.

 2\. Type**devmgmt.msc** in the run box and click**OK** button.

 3\. Expand the category and find your printer from the list. Right-click on the printer device and click**Uninstall** .

  After uninstallting the driver, you can go to the manufacturer’s website to download the appropriate driver. Locate the driver depending on the specific system your computer is running. Alternatively, you can install [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and use it to download the driver for your HP Deskjet D1360 printer.

  If you have other HP printers, and their drivers cannot be installed due to the same reason for installing HP Deskjet D1360 printer, the tips above is also helpful.
