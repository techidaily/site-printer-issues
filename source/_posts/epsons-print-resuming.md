![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b30b34ec2193-300x153.jpg)

 Many Epson printer driver are having an issue with their printer. Their Epson printer isn’t responding to their command when they’re trying to print something with it.

 This is a frustrating issue. You can’t print anything with your Epson printer, and this may stop you from getting your work done. But don’t worry. It can be fixed…

## To fix your Epson printer not printing issue

 The following are a few fixes that have helped many Epson printer users fix their issue. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Check your printer connection**](#a)
2. [**Set your printer as default printer**](#b)
3. [**Update your printer driver**](#c)
4. [**Check the Print Spooler service**](#d)
5. [**Clear all print jobs**](#e)
6. [**Use another program to print your document**](#f)
7. [**Check the status of your printer**](#g)

## Method 1: Check your printer connection

 Your Epson printer may not be connected to your computer properly. So it’s worth checking the connection between your printer and your computer.

**If you are using a USB cable to connect your printer:**

* Check if the cable is properly connected. If it isn’t, reconnect the cable and make sure they are properly seated into the ports on both your printer and your computer.
* Connect your printer directly to your computer without using a hub.
* Try connecting the cable to another USB port on your computer and see if this works for you.
* You may also need to experiment with another cable and see if there is any problem with the cable you’re using.

**If you are using a network printer:**

* Check your network connection as well as your network devices like your router and modem.
* View the network connection status of your printer and see if your printer is properly connected to the network.
* Reconnect or replace your network cable when necessary if your printer is using wired connection.
* For wireless printer, try reconnecting your printer to your home or work network.

 You may need to consult your printer manual for instructions when reconnecting your network printer.

**If you connect your printer via Bluetooth:**

* Make sure your printer is close enough to your computer.
* Try re-pairing your printer with your computer and see if this solves your problem.

 Check your printer manual for information about how to re-pair your printer and your computer.

## Method 2: Set your printer as the default printer

 Your Epson printer may not be working because it’s not set as the default printer on your computer. To set your Epson printer as your default printer:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type “**control** ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard.

 Hopefully, this helps you solve your problem. But if not, there are five more fixes for you to try.

## Method 3: Update your printer driver

 Your Epson printer may not be working properly if you’re using a wrong driver or it’s out of date. To see if that’s the case for you, you should update your printer driver.

## Method 4: Check the Print Spooler service

To check this service:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type “_**services.msc**_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Services window.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f1bc9808a1b.png)
2. Double-click**Print Spooler** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f29629de1e9.jpg)
3. Make sure its Startup type is set to**Automatic** and its Service status is**Running** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f299190ca46.png)
4. If not, set its Startup type to**Automatic** , and click the**Start** button.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2984ab53d0.png)
5. Click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f29d7e9e7e4.png)
6. Check to see if your Epson printer is able to print now.

 If it does, great! But if not, there are three more fixes for you to try…

## Method 5: Clear all print jobs

 You can’t use your Epson printer if the print queue of your printer gets stuck. In this case, you need to clear your print queue so you can use your printer.

 **What are print jobs?**
 When you try to print a file, your computer will place this task as a print job in the print queue (a queue of print jobs that is going to be printed) of your printer on your computer. Sometimes a print job in the queue gets stuck and stops the other print jobs in the queue from being printed.

To clear your print jobs:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type “_**services.msc**_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Services window.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f1bc9808a1b.png)
2. Double click**Print Spooler** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f29629de1e9.jpg)
3. Click**Stop** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a1317d8a2.png)
4. Minimize the Services window. Then open**File Explorer** (on your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E**  at the same time).  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a36c12e67.jpg)
5. Copy and paste the address**`%windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS`** to the address bar and press**Enter** on your keyboard to go to where the print jobs are stored.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a48b237b4.jpg)
6. Delete all the files in this folder.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2ab14ccc48.jpg)
7. Restore the Services window. Then double click the**Print Spooler** service.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f29629de1e9.jpg)
8. Click the**Start** button. After the service is started, click**OK** to save the change and close this dialog.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f2a9e345daa.png)
9. Close all the opened windows and turn off your computer.
10. Turn off your printer and unplug the power cable from it.
11. Leave your printer for at least one minute.
12. Plug the power cable to your printer and turn it on.
13. Turn on your computer. Then check to see if your Epson printer is able to print.

## Method 6: Use another program to print your document

 You may have a not printing issue with your printer if the program you are using to print is not working properly. Test your printer with another program. If the problem comes from your program, contact its developer or vendor for advice or install an alternative solution.

## Method 7: Check the status of your printer

 If you have tried all the methods above and your printer still can’t print, you should check the hardware status of your printer.

1. Check to see if you’re running out of **ink** or**toner** . You should replace the ink or toner cartridge when necessary.
2. If the issue occurs when you’ve**replaced a** **part** in your printer, install the original part and see if this fixes your issue.
3. You should also check if there is any**error displayed on your printer screen** . If it does, consult the user guide or the the customer support of Epson for instructions to fix the error.
4. If you are experiencing any issue you can’t resolve yourself, contact the customer support of Epson or bring it to an authorized service provider to**have it serviced** .
