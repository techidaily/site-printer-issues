 A missing or outdated printer driver in your computer can cause your printer to malfunction, and then your PCL XL Error occurs. To rule it out as as the cause for your PCL XL Error, you should update your printer driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update drivers** – You can manually update your printer driver by downloading the latest version of your drivers from manufacturers, and installing it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update drivers** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
